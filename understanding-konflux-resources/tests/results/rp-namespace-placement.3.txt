Based on the skill information, I can clearly answer your question about ReleasePlan (RP) namespace placement:

**ReleasePlan (RP) goes in the TENANT namespace** (your workspace).

Key points:
- You create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
- The Platform Engineer will create a corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace
- These two resources work together across different namespaces, with the RP referencing your Application

A typical workflow looks like:
1. You create a ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Platform Engineer creates a ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. The RPA references your RP and contains the necessary release credentials

Common mistake to avoid: Do NOT put the ReleasePlan in the managed namespace. It belongs in the tenant namespace where you manage your Application and Components.

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlans work with other Konflux resources?
