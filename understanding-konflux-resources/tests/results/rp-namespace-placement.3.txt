I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux, here's the guidance for Release Plan (RP) placement:

- Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**
- The tenant namespace is where you manage and define your application's release strategy
- Managed namespaces are usually used for more operational aspects of deployment, but not for creating the initial Release Plan

Key points:
1. Create your Release Plan (RP) in the tenant namespace
2. The tenant namespace is where you have control over defining your release process
3. Managed namespaces come into play later in the release workflow, typically for actual deployments

If you want to confirm the exact details for your specific Konflux setup, I recommend:
- Checking with your cluster administrator
- Reviewing your specific Konflux configuration
- Consulting the most recent Konflux documentation for your version

Would you like me to help you verify the specific namespace for your Release Plan creation?
