I'll help clarify this by using the Konflux resources skill to provide detailed information about ReleasePlans (RP) and their namespace placement.

Based on the Konflux resources skill information, I can provide clarity about ReleasePlan (RP) namespace placement:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**. This is the recommended approach in Konflux for several reasons:
- The tenant namespace is where users manage their application-specific resources
- It provides better isolation and organization of release-related configurations
- It allows for more granular control over release processes within the user's own namespace

The managed namespace is primarily used for:
- Storing and managing snapshots
- Hosting integration test scenarios
- Handling release plan admissions (RPAs)

So to directly answer your question: Create your ReleasePlan (RP) in the **tenant namespace**.

If you need more specific guidance about your particular use case or want to confirm this recommendation, I suggest consulting your Konflux cluster administrator or reviewing your specific project's configuration.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or help you understand more about how ReleasePlans work in Konflux?
