Based on the "Understanding Konflux Resources" skill, I can provide a clear answer:

**ReleasePlan (RP) MUST go in the TENANT namespace.**

❌ WRONG: Putting ReleasePlan in managed namespace
✅ CORRECT: ReleasePlan belongs in YOUR tenant namespace

Key points:
- ReleasePlan is created by the application owner (you)
- It points to your Application and defines release actions
- Credentials and actual release pipeline are handled separately

The companion resource, ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA), goes in the MANAGED namespace. This separation ensures:
- You control the release plan
- Platform engineers manage the credentials and pipeline details

So to summarize: Create your ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace, and let platform engineers create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace.
