Let me help clarify the namespace placement for ReleasePlan (RP) based on the understanding-konflux-resources skill.

ReleasePlan (RP) should be created in the TENANT namespace. 

Here's a quick breakdown:
- ✅ ReleasePlan (RP): GOES IN TENANT NAMESPACE
- ❌ NOT in managed namespace
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA): GOES IN MANAGED NAMESPACE

The key points are:
1. You (as a user/developer) create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. The platform engineer creates the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. This separation keeps your release plans in your workspace while keeping sensitive credentials in a controlled namespace

Common mistake to avoid: Do NOT put your ReleasePlan in the managed namespace. That's not where it belongs, and you won't have permission to create resources there.

Example structure:
```
Tenant Namespace:
- ReleasePlan: Points to your Application
- Describes release workflow you want

Managed Namespace:
- ReleasePlanAdmission: Contains credentials
- Defines actual release pipeline details
```

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission work together?
