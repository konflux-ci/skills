I apologize for the continued error. Since I can't directly search the web, I'll provide some general guidance based on typical Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift practices:

In Konflux, the recommendation is typically to create your Resource Planner (RP) in the managed namespace. The managed namespace is specifically designed for hosting and managing application resources in a controlled, platform-managed environment. 

Key considerations:
1. Managed Namespace:
   - Provides centralized resource management
   - Offers better isolation and control
   - Typically recommended for most application deployments

2. Tenant Namespace:
   - Usually used for more developer-specific or temporary resources
   - Less recommended for core application components

However, to get the most accurate and up-to-date guidance, I recommend:
1. Checking the official Konflux documentation
2. Consulting with your team's platform engineering team
3. Reviewing any specific organizational guidelines for your specific Konflux setup

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about namespace usage in your Konflux environment?
