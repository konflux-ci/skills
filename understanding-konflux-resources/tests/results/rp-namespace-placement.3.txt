Let me help you understand the ReleasePlan (RP) namespace placement in Konflux:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where you manage and configure your application's release processes
2. It provides better isolation and control over your release workflows
3. The managed namespace is primarily used for runtime resources and actual deployments

Key points:
- Create your ReleasePlan (RP) in the tenant namespace
- The tenant namespace is where you define your release strategies and configurations
- Managed namespaces are more for the actual deployment and runtime artifacts

If you want to confirm the exact placement or have specific requirements, I recommend consulting your Konflux administrator or checking your specific cluster's configuration. Different organizations might have slight variations in their namespace management strategy.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the ReleasePlan namespace placement?
