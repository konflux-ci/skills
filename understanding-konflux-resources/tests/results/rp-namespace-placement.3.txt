I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where most application-specific resources are managed
2. ReleasePlans are closely tied to the specific application's release process
3. They represent the user's intent for releasing a specific version of their application

The managed namespace is usually used for:
- Actual build and deployment artifacts
- Snapshots
- Integration test scenarios

So to directly answer your question: Create your ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace. This allows you to define your release strategy within the context of your specific application's namespace.

If you want to confirm the exact details for your specific Konflux setup, I recommend:
1. Checking your cluster's specific configuration
2. Consulting with your team's platform engineering or DevOps team
3. Reviewing the Konflux documentation specific to your organization's implementation

Would you like me to help you understand more about how ReleasePlans work in Konflux?
