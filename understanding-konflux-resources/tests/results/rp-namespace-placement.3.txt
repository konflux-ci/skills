I apologize for the error. Let me provide a clear explanation about ReleasePlan (RP) placement in Konflux:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) should be created in the tenant namespace, not the managed namespace. 

Key points:
- The tenant namespace is where you define and manage your ReleasePlans
- Managed namespaces are typically used for running snapshots and actual deployments
- Creating RPs in the tenant namespace allows for better organization and separation of concerns

If you're unsure about the specific namespace for your project, you can:
1. Check with your Konflux cluster administrator
2. Verify the namespace configuration in your Konflux project settings
3. Ensure you have the correct permissions to create ReleasePlans in the tenant namespace

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of ReleasePlan creation in Konflux?
