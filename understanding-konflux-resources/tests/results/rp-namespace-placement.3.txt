I apologize for the error. Let me provide guidance about Release Plan (RP) placement in Konflux based on standard practices:

Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This means:
- The Release Plan should be created in the namespace associated with your specific team or project
- The tenant namespace is where you manage and define your release strategies
- Managed namespaces are usually used for specific deployment-related resources, but not for the initial Release Plan creation

To break this down:
1. Tenant Namespace ✅: Create your Release Plan here
   - Contains the Release Plan custom resource
   - Defines your release strategy
   - Managed by your team

2. Managed Namespace ❌: Do NOT create the Release Plan here
   - Used for actual deployments and runtime resources
   - Generated or managed by the platform

If you're unsure about your specific tenant namespace, you might want to:
- Check with your Konflux platform administrator
- Verify the namespace associated with your project or team
- Look at other resources your team has created to confirm the correct namespace

Would you like me to help you understand more about how Release Plans work in Konflux?
