I apologize for the difficulties. Let me provide some general guidance based on typical Konflux architecture:

In Konflux, Release Pipelines (RP) are typically created in the managed namespace. The managed namespace is designed to host the actual deployment and release processes, while the tenant namespace is more focused on development and initial artifact creation.

Key points:
1. Managed Namespace: 
   - This is where your Release Pipelines should be created
   - Handles the actual deployment and release processes
   - Provides a controlled environment for releasing applications

2. Tenant Namespace:
   - Primarily used for development activities
   - Hosts initial component builds and development workflows
   - Not typically the place for creating Release Pipelines

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
1. Checking your specific Konflux platform's documentation
2. Consulting with your platform administrator
3. Verifying the exact namespace configuration in your specific Konflux setup

Would you like me to help you locate more specific documentation about namespace usage in your Konflux environment?
