I apologize for the persistent error. Since I cannot use WebSearch, I'll provide guidance based on my current knowledge and recommend verifying the details:

In Konflux (OpenShift Pipelines), the RPA (Repository Pipeline Adapter) and RP (Repository Provider) are typically related but do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. The key considerations are:

1. The RPA references the RP through a reference or configuration.
2. They can be in different namespaces, but must be configured to communicate correctly.
3. The reference is usually done through a CustomResource or configuration that specifies the RP's details.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
1. Checking the official Red Hat documentation for Konflux
2. Consulting the specific Konflux configuration in your cluster
3. Verifying the exact implementation in your specific setup

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific configuration in your Konflux environment? If you can provide more context or share some configuration files, I can help you understand the exact relationship between RPA and RP.
