To directly answer your questions:

1. **How does the RPA reference the RP?**
The RPA references the ReleasePlan through a specific configuration that links the two resources. Typically, this is done by matching the Application name and other identifying information between the RP and RPA.

2. **Do they need to be in the same namespace?**
**No, they do NOT need to be in the same namespace.** In fact, they are intentionally placed in DIFFERENT namespaces:
- ReleasePlan (RP) is in the TENANT namespace
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is in the MANAGED namespace

This separation is a deliberate design to:
- Keep release intentions with the developers
- Isolate sensitive release credentials
- Provide a clear security boundary

A platform engineer will create the RPA that corresponds to a developer's RP, ensuring the two resources are linked while maintaining namespace separation.
