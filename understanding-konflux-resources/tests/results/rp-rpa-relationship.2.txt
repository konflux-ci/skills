Based on the skill documentation, I can provide a detailed answer about how the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP):

The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) and ReleasePlan (RP) are intentionally placed in DIFFERENT namespaces:
- ReleasePlan (RP) is created in the TENANT namespace (your workspace)
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created in the MANAGED namespace (platform team's controlled namespace)

Key points about their relationship:
1. The RPA is manually created by a Platform Engineer in the managed namespace
2. The RPA references the ReleasePlan from the tenant namespace
3. They do NOT need to be in the same namespace - in fact, they are INTENTIONALLY placed in different namespaces

The purpose of this separation is to:
- Keep release credentials isolated from development teams
- Allow developers to request releases (via ReleasePlan)
- Enable platform engineers to control the release pipeline and credentials (via ReleasePlanAdmission)

So to directly answer your questions:
- The RPA references the RP through a cross-namespace reference
- They do NOT need to be in the same namespace - they are DESIGNED to be in different namespaces

Typical workflow:
1. You (developer) create a ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Platform Engineer creates a corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. The RPA points to your specific ReleasePlan across the namespace boundary

This design ensures separation of concerns and security in the release process.
