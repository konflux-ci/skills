Let me elaborate based on my understanding of Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references a ReleasePlan (RP) through a specific relationship, and they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. 

The key points are:
1. The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) contains a reference to the ReleasePlan (RP)
2. This reference is typically done through a cross-namespace reference
3. The RPA can exist in a different namespace from the ReleasePlan it's admitting

Specifically, the RPA will have a reference to the ReleasePlan using its name and namespace. This allows for flexibility in how release plans and their admissions are organized across different namespaces in a Konflux environment.

This cross-namespace referencing is a feature that provides more granular control over release management, allowing different teams or components to manage their release plans and admissions independently while maintaining a clear connection between them.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of how RPAs reference RPs in Konflux?
