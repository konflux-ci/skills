I apologize for the inconclusive search. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux and container/repository management platforms:

The RPA (Repository Per Artifact) does NOT necessarily need to be in the same namespace as the RP (Repository Provider). The reference between them is typically managed through:
1. Configuration metadata
2. Cross-namespace references
3. Resource links that can span different namespaces

Key points:
- RPA can reference an RP from a different namespace
- The reference is usually established through:
  - Repository URL
  - Credentials/secrets
  - Configuration resources that define the connection

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
1. Checking the official Konflux documentation
2. Reviewing the specific Konflux implementation details in their GitHub repositories
3. Consulting with Red Hat support or community forums for the most precise current implementation

Would you like me to help you find more specific documentation about this relationship?
