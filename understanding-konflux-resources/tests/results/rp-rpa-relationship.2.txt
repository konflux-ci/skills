I apologize for the error. Let me explain what I know about Konflux RPAs and RPs based on my existing knowledge:

In Konflux, a Release Plan Admission (RPA) references a Release Plan (RP), and they typically need to be in the same namespace. The RPA is essentially an admission process that validates and approves a specific Release Plan.

Key points:
1. The RPA is created to validate a specific Release Plan
2. The RPA and RP should be in the same namespace
3. The RPA contains references to the specific Release Plan it is admitting

The reference is usually done through a direct reference in the RPA's specification, where the Release Plan's name and namespace are explicitly mentioned.

An example structure might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlanAdmission
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  releasePlan: 
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: my-namespace
```

To get the most up-to-date and precise information, I recommend:
1. Checking the Konflux documentation
2. Reviewing the custom resource definitions in the Konflux project
3. Consulting with the Konflux team for the most current implementation details

Would you like me to help you find more specific documentation about this relationship?
