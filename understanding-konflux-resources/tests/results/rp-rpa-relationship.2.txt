Let me help you understand the relationship between ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) and ReleaseПлан (RP) in Konflux:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleaseПlan (RP), but they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. However, there are some important considerations:

1. Reference Mechanism:
   - The RPA typically references the ReleaseПlan (RP) through a specific reference in its spec.
   - This reference allows the RPA to validate and potentially modify the release process defined in the original ReleaseПlan.

2. Namespace Relationship:
   - RPAs do not require being in the exact same namespace as the ReleaseПlan they reference.
   - The RPA can reference a ReleaseПlan from a different namespace, providing flexibility in how release plans are managed across different namespaces.

3. Cross-Namespace References:
   - This cross-namespace referencing allows for more complex release management strategies.
   - It enables teams to have centralized release plans that can be admitted or modified by different teams or components.

Practical Implications:
- An RPA can point to an RP in another namespace
- The reference is typically done through a name and namespace specification in the RPA's configuration
- This design supports more distributed and flexible release management approaches in Konflux

If you need more specific details about how exactly this reference is implemented in your specific Konflux setup, I'd recommend checking the actual RPA and RP resource definitions in your cluster or consulting your team's specific Konflux configuration.
