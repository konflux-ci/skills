I apologize for the technical difficulties. Let me explain based on my understanding of Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) typically references a ReleasePlan (RP) using a cross-namespace reference. The RPA does NOT need to be in the same namespace as the ReleasePlan. 

Specifically:
- The RPA contains a reference to the ReleasePlan (RP) using a specific field
- This reference can point to an RP in a different namespace
- This allows for flexible management of release plans across different namespaces

The typical reference looks something like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlanAdmission
metadata:
  name: my-rpa
spec:
  releasePlanRef:
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: different-namespace
```

In this example, the RPA can reference an RP in a different namespace by explicitly specifying both the name and the namespace of the ReleasePlan.

This cross-namespace referencing provides flexibility in how release plans and their admissions can be organized and managed within a Konflux environment.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of how RPAs reference RPs in Konflux?
