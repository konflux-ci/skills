I apologize for the error. Let me explain based on my current understanding of Konflux resources:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlan (RP) and ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. The ReleasePlanAdmission is typically created in the managed namespace and references the ReleasePlan, which is usually created in the tenant namespace.

The key relationship is that the RPA references the RP through a specific reference mechanism:
- The RPA contains a reference to the specific ReleasePlan it is admitting
- This reference is typically done through a cross-namespace reference
- The RPA confirms and potentially modifies the admission of the ReleasePlan across different namespaces

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
1. Checking the current Konflux documentation
2. Reviewing the specific Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission
3. Consulting with your Konflux cluster administrator for the exact implementation details in your specific setup

Would you like me to help you find more specific documentation about this relationship?
