Let me use the understanding-konflux-resources skill to provide a detailed explanation.

No, the ReleasePlan (RP) and ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) do NOT need to be in the same namespace. In fact, they are intentionally placed in different namespaces by design:

- **ReleasePlan (RP)** is created in the **TENANT namespace**
  - Created by the application owner
  - Defines the release strategy for an Application
  - Contains high-level release configuration

- **ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)** is created in the **MANAGED namespace**
  - Created by Platform Engineers
  - Contains actual release credentials and pipeline details
  - Provides the technical implementation of the release

The reference between RP and RPA is typically made through matching labels or names. The RPA will have a specification that points to or matches the ReleasePlan, allowing it to implement the release strategy defined in the tenant namespace.

Here's a conceptual example of how they relate:

```
Tenant Namespace:
- ReleasePlan: "my-app-prod-release"
  - Specifies: Which Application to release
  - Defines: Release strategy/targets

Managed Namespace:
- ReleasePlanAdmission: "my-app-prod-release-admission"
  - References: "my-app-prod-release"
  - Contains: Actual credentials
  - Defines: Specific release pipeline details
```

Key points:
- Different namespaces (tenant vs managed)
- RPA implements the RP
- Separation of concerns: 
  - Tenant defines WHAT to release
  - Platform defines HOW to release

This design ensures:
1. Developers can request releases
2. Platform engineers control release credentials
3. Secure separation of configuration and secrets

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?
