I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) typically references a ReleasePlan (RP), and they are usually expected to be in the same namespace. The RPA is created to validate and admit a specific ReleasePlan, serving as a mechanism to control and validate release processes.

The reference between RPA and RP is typically done through:
1. A spec field in the RPA that points to the specific ReleasePlan
2. Namespace matching is a common practice to ensure logical grouping and access control

To ensure the most up-to-date and precise information, I recommend:
1. Checking the current Konflux documentation
2. Verifying the specific version of Konflux you're using
3. Consulting with your team's Konflux configuration

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about the RPA and RP relationship in your specific Konflux setup?
