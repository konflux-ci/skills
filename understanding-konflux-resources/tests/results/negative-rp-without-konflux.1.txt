Based on Konflux best practices, Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the same namespace as your Application. This ensures that the Release Plan is closely associated with the specific application's components and resources.

To determine the exact namespace:
1. Verify the namespace of your existing Application
2. Create the Release Plan in that same namespace

If you're unsure about your current namespace, you can:
- Check your existing Application's namespace using `oc get applications`
- Confirm the current namespace with `oc project`

Would you like me to help you locate the correct namespace or provide more details about creating a Release Plan in Konflux?
