Based on the Konflux resource management approach, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This means you should create your ReleasePlan in the namespace associated with your specific project or team.

Key points to remember:
1. ReleasePlans are usually created in the tenant namespace
2. They are associated with specific Applications and Components
3. They define the release strategy for your application

To create a ReleasePlan, you'll want to:
1. Ensure you're working in the correct namespace
2. Have your Application and Component resources already defined
3. Use the appropriate Konflux custom resource configuration for the ReleasePlan

Would you like me to help you draft the ReleasePlan configuration or provide more specific guidance about creating it in your project's namespace?
