Based on the Konflux resource management principles, Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. 

Here are the key points:
- Release Plans are user-created resources
- They should be created in the tenant namespace, not the managed namespace
- The tenant namespace is where you define how and when you want to release your application

To create a Release Plan, you'll want to:
1. Ensure you're in the correct tenant namespace
2. Define the Release Plan with details about your desired release strategy
3. Specify which Application or Component you want to release
4. Set any release parameters or conditions

Would you like me to help you draft a Release Plan configuration or provide more specific guidance about creating it in the correct namespace?
