Based on the exploration, here are the key points for creating your Release Plan (RP):

1. There's no single universal location for RPs in Konflux projects
2. You'll want to create the RP in:
   - A namespace specific to your application or releases
   - A directory like `/manifests/release-plans/` or `/kubernetes/release-plans/`

The exact location depends on your specific project structure. I recommend:
1. Checking with your project team about their preferred namespace
2. Looking for existing release-related directories in the project
3. Following the typical YAML structure for ReleasePlans

Would you like me to help you locate the specific namespace or directory for your RP? If you can provide more context about the project, I can give more precise guidance.
