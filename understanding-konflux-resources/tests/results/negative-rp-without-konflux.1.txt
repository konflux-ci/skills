I apologize for the error. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources, here's the guidance for creating a ReleasePlan:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**. This means you should create the ReleasePlan in the namespace associated with your specific project or team. 

Key points to remember:
- ReleasePlans are user-created resources
- They are created in the tenant (user-controlled) namespace
- They define the release strategy for your application or component

The typical workflow is:
1. Ensure you're in the correct tenant namespace
2. Create the ReleasePlan resource using kubectl or your preferred Konflux management tool
3. The ReleasePlan will then be used to manage the release process for your application

If you're unsure about the exact namespace, I recommend:
- Checking with your team's Konflux administrator
- Verifying the current namespace using `kubectl config current-context`
- Confirming the specific tenant namespace for your project

Would you like me to help you create the ReleasePlan or do you need more specific guidance about its configuration?
