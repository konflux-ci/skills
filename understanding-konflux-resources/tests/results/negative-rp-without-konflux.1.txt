Let me provide some context about Release Plans (RP) in Konflux:

Release Plans (RP) are typically created in the same namespace as your Application. In Konflux, RPs are closely tied to specific Applications and help manage the release process for components within that application.

To determine the exact namespace:
1. Check the namespace of your existing Konflux Application
2. Create the Release Plan in that same namespace

Best practices:
- Ensure you have an existing Application resource
- The RP should reference the specific components you want to release
- Create the RP using a YAML configuration that specifies:
  - The target Application
  - Components to be released
  - Release strategy
  - Any specific release parameters

Would you like me to help you locate the correct namespace or show you an example Release Plan configuration for your project? If you can provide more context about your specific Konflux setup, I can give more precise guidance.
