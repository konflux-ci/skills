I'll help you understand where to create your ReleasePlan (RP) in Konflux. 

ReleasePlans are typically created in the same namespace as your Application or in a designated release management namespace. The specific location depends on your project's configuration and workflow. Here are some key points:

1. Namespace Considerations:
- If you have an existing Application in a specific namespace, you'll likely want to create the RP in the same namespace.
- Some teams use a dedicated release management namespace for all ReleasePlans.

2. Best Practices:
- The RP should be associated with the specific Application and Components you're planning to release.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in the target namespace.

To get the most accurate advice, I recommend:
- Checking with your team's Konflux CI configuration
- Verifying the current namespace of your Application
- Confirming the specific namespace used for release management in your project

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific namespace for your project's ReleasePlan?
