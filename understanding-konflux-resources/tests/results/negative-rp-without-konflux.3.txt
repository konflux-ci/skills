Let me explain based on Konflux best practices:

In Konflux, Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is where you manage your application-specific resources. The tenant namespace is specific to your project or team, and it's where you'll define how and when your application components should be released.

Key points about creating a Release Plan:
- Create the Release Plan in the tenant namespace
- The Release Plan is associated with a specific Application
- It defines the release strategy for your application's components

If you're unsure about the exact namespace, I recommend:
1. Confirming the tenant namespace name with your team or project lead
2. Verifying the namespace using `oc get namespaces` or your cluster management tool
3. Checking the existing Application resource to ensure you're creating the Release Plan in the correct namespace

Would you like me to help you create the Release Plan or do you need more information about where to place it?
