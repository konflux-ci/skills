The skill provides insights into Konflux resources. For ReleasePlans (RPs):

- RPs are typically created in the same namespace as your Application
- They define the release strategy and configuration for your application's components
- Usually created by the application team or release engineers
- Often associated with a specific application and its components

However, to give you the most accurate guidance, could you provide more context about:
1. Which project or application are you working on?
2. Do you already have an Application resource defined in Konflux?
3. Are you looking to create a ReleasePlan for a specific component or the entire application?

The exact namespace and specific configuration will depend on your project's setup in Konflux. If you can share more details, I can help you determine the precise location and configuration for creating your ReleasePlan.
