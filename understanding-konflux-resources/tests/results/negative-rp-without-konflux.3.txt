Based on Konflux resource management principles, you should create your ReleasePlan (RP) in the tenant namespace. Specifically:

- ReleasePlans are typically created in the tenant namespace associated with your application
- They are user-created resources that define how and when a specific version of an application should be released
- The tenant namespace is where you manage and track your application's release lifecycle

To create a ReleasePlan, you'll want to:
1. Ensure you're working in the correct tenant namespace for your project
2. Define the ReleasePlan resource with details about the release, such as:
   - Which application components are being released
   - Target release parameters
   - Any specific release strategies or configurations

Would you like me to help you draft the specific YAML configuration for creating a ReleasePlan in your project's tenant namespace?
