I apologize for the error. Let me provide some general guidance about ReleasePlans in Konflux:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This means you should create your ReleasePlan in the namespace associated with your specific project or team. 

The key considerations for creating a ReleasePlan are:
1. It should be created in the tenant namespace
2. It's associated with the specific Application you're working on
3. It defines the release strategy for your Component(s)

To get the most accurate information specific to your project, I recommend:
1. Consulting your team's Konflux configuration
2. Checking with your team's DevOps or platform engineering team about the specific namespace conventions
3. Verifying the exact namespace where other ReleasePlans for your project are currently created

Would you like me to help you find the specific namespace or provide more details about creating a ReleasePlan in your project?
