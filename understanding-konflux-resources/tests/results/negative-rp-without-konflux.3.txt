To help you determine the right location for creating your Release Plan (RP), I'll provide some general guidance about Konflux resources:

In Konflux, Release Plans (RPs) are typically:
- Created in the same namespace as the Application
- Associated with a specific Application and its Components
- Used to define how and when a set of components will be released

The key considerations for creating an RP are:
1. Ensure you're in the correct project namespace
2. Have an existing Application defined
3. Have Components that you want to include in the release plan

Best practices:
- Create the RP in the same namespace as your Application
- Make sure the RP references the specific Components you want to release
- Align the RP with your Application's release strategy

Would you like me to help you confirm the specific namespace or Application context for creating this Release Plan? If you can provide more details about your project's structure, I can give more precise guidance.
