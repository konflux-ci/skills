Based on the skill information, I can directly answer your question about ReleasePlan (RP) placement:

**ReleasePlan (RP) should be created in the TENANT namespace.**

Key points to remember:
- ReleasePlan goes in YOUR tenant namespace (where your Application and Components are)
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) goes in the MANAGED namespace (created by Platform Engineers)

The workflow is:
1. You create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Platform Engineers create a corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. These two resources work together across different namespaces

This separation ensures that:
- You control the release plan for your application
- Platform team controls the release credentials and pipeline configuration
- Sensitive credentials remain in the managed namespace

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission interact in the Konflux workflow?
