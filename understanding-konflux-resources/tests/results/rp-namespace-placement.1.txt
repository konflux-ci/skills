I apologize for the persistent error. Since I cannot use web search, I'll provide guidance based on my existing knowledge about Konflux and container-native development practices:

In Konflux, Release Pipelines (RPs) are typically created in the **managed namespace**. Here's why:

1. The managed namespace is specifically designed to handle deployment and release-related resources.
2. It provides better isolation and control over the release process.
3. This approach helps separate the development workflow (which often occurs in the tenant namespace) from the release and deployment workflow.

Key points:
- Tenant Namespace: Used for development, storing source code, and initial build configurations
- Managed Namespace: Used for release pipelines, deployments, and release-related resources

Recommendation: Create your Release Pipeline in the **managed namespace**.

If you want to confirm the exact configuration for your specific Konflux setup, I suggest:
1. Checking with your team's infrastructure documentation
2. Consulting your Konflux cluster administrator
3. Reviewing the specific Konflux configuration for your organization

Would you like me to help you understand more about how to create the Release Pipeline in the managed namespace?
