I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where you manage your application's resources
2. ReleasePlans are a way to define how and when your application will be released
3. They are closely tied to the specific application and its components

Key points:
- Create your ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace where your Application and Component resources are defined
- The managed namespace is usually used for actual deployments and runtime resources
- The tenant namespace is where you define your release strategy and configuration

Recommendation: Create your ReleasePlan (RP) in the tenant namespace associated with your application.

If you want to confirm the exact details for your specific Konflux setup, I recommend:
1. Checking with your Konflux administrator
2. Reviewing your specific cluster's configuration
3. Consulting the current Konflux documentation for the most up-to-date guidance

Would you like me to help you understand more about how ReleasePlans work in Konflux?
