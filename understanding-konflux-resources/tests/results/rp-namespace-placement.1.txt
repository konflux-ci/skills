Based on the skill information, let me directly answer your question about ReleasePlan (RP) namespace placement:

**ReleasePlan (RP) should be created in the TENANT namespace.**

Key points:
- You create the ReleasePlan in YOUR tenant namespace
- Platform Engineers create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the MANAGED namespace
- The RP references your Application
- The RPA references your RP and contains release pipeline credentials

Incorrect approaches:
❌ Do NOT create ReleasePlan in the managed namespace
❌ Do NOT expect ReleasePlan to be auto-created by Konflux

Correct approach:
✅ Create ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
✅ Work with Platform Engineers to create matching ReleasePlanAdmission in managed namespace

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission work together across namespaces?
