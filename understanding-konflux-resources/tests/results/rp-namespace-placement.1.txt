Let me clarify the namespace placement for Release Plans (RP) in Konflux based on my knowledge:

Release Plans should be created in the **tenant namespace**. This is different from some other Konflux resources that might be placed in managed namespaces. 

The key points are:
- Release Plans are typically created and managed by the tenant (user/team)
- They are part of the user's own workflow and configuration
- The tenant namespace provides the appropriate context for defining how and when to release your application components

This means when you're working with a Release Plan in Konflux, you'll want to create it within your project's tenant namespace, giving you full control over the release process.

If you need more specific details about the exact process of creating a Release Plan or have any follow-up questions about namespace usage in Konflux, please feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help you further.
