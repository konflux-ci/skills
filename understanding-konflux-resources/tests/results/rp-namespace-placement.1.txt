Let me provide some guidance based on Konflux resource management:

In Konflux, Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where users have direct control and create their application-specific resources
2. Managed namespaces are primarily used for automated processes and system-level management
3. Release Plans are user-driven resources that represent the release strategy for a specific application or component

Key points to remember:
- Tenant namespace: Where you create your ReleasePlan
- Managed namespace: Used for system-level operations and automated processes like ReleasePlanAdmissions

So, to directly answer your question: Create your Release Plan (RP) in the **tenant namespace**.

If you need more specific details about Konflux resource placement or have follow-up questions, please feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help you further.
