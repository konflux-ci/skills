Let me provide some guidance about ReleasePlan placement in Konflux:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where users have direct control and can manage their application's release processes.
2. ReleasePlans are user-defined resources that represent the release strategy for an application or component.
3. They are part of the user's workflow and should be created and managed within the tenant's own namespace.

The managed namespace, in contrast, is usually used for storing build artifacts, snapshots, and other system-generated resources.

So, to directly answer your question: You should create your ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace.

If you'd like more specific details about Konflux resource placement or have follow-up questions about ReleasePlans, please feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help you further.
