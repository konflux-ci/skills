I apologize for the search limitation. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**. 

Key points:
- The tenant namespace is where you manage and define your application's release processes
- Managed namespaces are more for storing specific artifacts and running actual deployments
- ReleasePlans define the release strategy and workflow for your application
- They coordinate how your application's components will be built, tested, and released

If you want to confirm the exact placement or have specific details about your use case, I recommend:
1. Checking your Konflux platform's specific documentation
2. Consulting with your team's platform engineers
3. Reviewing the specific configuration of your Konflux installation

Would you like me to help you understand more about how ReleasePlans work in Konflux?
