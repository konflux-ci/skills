I apologize for the inconvenience. Since I cannot directly fetch the documentation, I'll provide general guidance based on typical CI/CD platform practices:

In most Konflux configurations, Repositories (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**. The tenant namespace is usually:
- Specific to your project or team
- Where you have full control and permissions
- Used for managing your application's resources
- Isolated from shared or infrastructure-level namespaces

The managed namespace, in contrast, is often:
- Used for shared services or platform-level resources
- Managed by the platform administrators
- Not typically where individual project repositories should be created

To get the most accurate information, I recommend:
1. Checking your Konflux platform's specific documentation
2. Consulting with your platform administrator
3. Reviewing your specific Konflux instance's configuration

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about your Konflux namespace setup?
