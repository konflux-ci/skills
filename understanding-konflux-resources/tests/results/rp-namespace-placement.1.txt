Based on the Konflux resource guidelines, I'll help clarify the namespace placement for ReleasePlan (RP).

**ReleasePlan (RP) goes in the TENANT namespace**

Here's a quick breakdown:
- ✅ ReleasePlan: Created in YOUR tenant namespace
- ❌ NOT in managed namespace
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA): Created in MANAGED namespace by platform engineers

Key points:
- ReleasePlan is a user-created resource that maps an Application to a release action
- It belongs to the application owner (you)
- Platform team handles credentials and pipeline details via ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace

Example scenario:
```
Tenant Namespace (You create):
- ReleasePlan: "prod-release-plan"
  - Points to your Application
  - Defines release workflow

Managed Namespace (Platform team creates):
- ReleasePlanAdmission: "prod-admission"
  - Contains production credentials
  - Defines actual release pipeline
```

Common mistake to avoid:
❌ "I'll put my ReleasePlan in the managed namespace for security"
✅ "I'll create my ReleasePlan in my tenant namespace, and the platform team will create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission"

Would you like me to elaborate on the relationship between ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission?
