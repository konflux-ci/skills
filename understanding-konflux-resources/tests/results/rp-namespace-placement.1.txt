I'll provide guidance based on my current understanding of Konflux resource management:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the managed namespace, not the tenant namespace. Here's why:

1. Managed Namespace: This is where release-related resources are typically managed and coordinated.
2. Tenant Namespace: This is usually reserved for application and component resources.

The key reasons for creating RPs in the managed namespace include:
- Centralized release management
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved governance and control over release processes

To confirm this recommendation, I suggest:
1. Consulting your specific Konflux platform documentation
2. Checking with your platform administrators
3. Reviewing your organization's specific Konflux configuration

Would you like me to help you verify the exact placement for your specific Konflux setup?
