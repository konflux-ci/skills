I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the managed namespace. The managed namespace is where the actual release and deployment processes are orchestrated in Konflux. 

Key points:
- Tenant namespace: Used for initial application and component definitions
- Managed namespace: Where ReleasePlans are created and managed
- The ReleasePlan defines how and when a specific component or application will be released

To confirm this precisely, I recommend:
1. Checking your specific Konflux cluster configuration
2. Consulting with your team's DevOps or platform engineering team
3. Reviewing the latest Konflux documentation for any recent changes in namespace management

Would you like me to help you create the ReleasePlan in the managed namespace?
