Based on the skill's detailed explanation, I can directly answer your question:

No, you do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

The RPA is specifically created by the Platform Engineer in the managed namespace. This is a critical point in Konflux's resource management. Here are the key details:

- **Who creates RPA**: Platform Engineer
- **Where it's created**: Managed namespace (NOT your tenant namespace)
- **What it contains**: Release pipeline credentials and configuration

As a developer/user, you will:
1. Create the ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
2. The Platform Engineer will then create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace

This separation ensures that sensitive release credentials are kept isolated from development teams while still allowing you to request and manage releases.

Would you like me to elaborate on the relationship between ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission or explain how they work together in the release process?
