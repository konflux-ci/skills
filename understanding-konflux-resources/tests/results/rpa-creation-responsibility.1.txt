No, you typically do not directly create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in Konflux. The RPA is usually created automatically by the system based on the ReleasePlan and the evaluation of various conditions.

Here's a brief breakdown:
- ReleasePlan (RP) is created by the user or the application team
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is automatically generated by Konflux's release service
- The RPA represents the admission of a specific release plan, taking into account various policies, checks, and conditions

The RPA serves as a record of whether a release plan has been approved or rejected based on the defined criteria in the Konflux system. It's an automated process that evaluates the ReleasePlan against the current state of the application, snapshots, and any configured release policies.

If you want to understand more about the release process in Konflux, I recommend checking the Konflux documentation or consulting with your team about the specific release workflows in your environment.
