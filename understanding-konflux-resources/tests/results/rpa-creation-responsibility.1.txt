No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself in Konflux. 

In the Konflux CI/CD workflow:
- The RPA is usually automatically created by the system
- It's generated based on the ReleasePlan (RP) and the current state of your application and components
- The RPA represents the system's admission or approval of a release plan

The RPA is a system-generated resource that:
- Validates if the release can proceed
- Checks if all required conditions for the release are met
- Is created by the Konflux system automatically after you define a ReleasePlan

If you want to understand or work with RPAs, you would typically:
1. Create a ReleasePlan (RP)
2. Let the Konflux system generate the corresponding RPA
3. Review the RPA to see if the release is approved

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation about ReleasePlanAdmissions in Konflux?
