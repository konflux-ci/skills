No, you do not directly create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in Konflux. 

In the Konflux workflow:
- The ReleasePlan (RP) is typically created first by the application team
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is automatically created by the system based on the ReleasePlan
- The system (specifically the release service) generates the RPA to validate and manage the release process

The RPA is an automated resource that:
- Tracks the admission status of a release
- Ensures the release meets the necessary criteria and policies
- Is created automatically after a ReleasePlan is submitted

So while you set up the ReleasePlan, the ReleasePlanAdmission is automatically generated by Konflux as part of the release workflow. You don't manually create the RPA yourself.

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlans and ReleasePlanAdmissions work in the Konflux ecosystem?
