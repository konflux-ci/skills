No, you do not create the RPA (ReleasePlanAdmission) yourself. In Konflux, the RPA is typically automatically created by the system based on the ReleasePlan (RP) and the current state of your application's components.

The typical flow is:
1. You create a ReleasePlan (RP)
2. The Konflux system automatically generates the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)

The RPA represents the system's admission or validation of the release plan, checking things like:
- Component readiness
- Build and test status
- Namespace placement
- Other release criteria

So while you define the ReleasePlan, the RPA is a system-generated resource that confirms whether the release plan can be implemented based on the current state of your application and its components.

If you want to understand more about the specifics of RPAs in your specific Konflux setup, I recommend consulting your team's specific implementation details or Konflux documentation.
