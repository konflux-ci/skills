Based on the detailed Konflux resources explanation, I can directly answer your question:

No, you do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). The RPA is created by the Platform Engineer in the managed namespace. 

Key points:
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is manually created by Platform Engineers
- It is created in the managed namespace (not your tenant namespace)
- YOU create the ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
- The Platform Engineer then creates a corresponding RPA in the managed namespace to define the release pipeline and credentials

The workflow is:
1. You create a ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Platform Engineer creates a ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. These two resources work together across different namespaces

So to directly answer your question: No, you do not create the RPA. That's a task for your Platform Engineering team.
