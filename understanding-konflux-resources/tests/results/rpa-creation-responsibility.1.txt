I apologize for the persistent search error. Since I cannot directly search the web, I'll provide some general guidance based on my existing knowledge about Konflux:

In Konflux (Red Hat's developer platform), you typically do not create the RPA (Remote Procedure Action) directly. Instead, the RPA is usually automatically generated as part of the build and deployment process when you:

1. Import your source code repository
2. Configure your application in the Konflux interface
3. Set up your build pipeline

The RPA is typically created automatically by the Konflux system to manage the deployment and lifecycle of your application. It's part of the infrastructure-as-code approach, where the pipeline and deployment configurations are generated based on your application's specifications.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
- Checking the official Red Hat Konflux documentation
- Consulting with your team's DevOps or platform engineering team
- Reviewing the specific configuration of your Konflux environment

Would you like me to help you understand more about the Konflux application creation process? If you have more specific details about what you're trying to achieve, I can provide more targeted guidance.
