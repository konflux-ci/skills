Based on the "Understanding Konflux Resources" skill, the platform engineer creates the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

Specifically, from the resource table in the skill:

| Resource | Who Creates | Namespace |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| ReleasePlanAdmission | Platform Engineer | **Managed** |

The key points are:
- YOU (as a developer/user) create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
- The PLATFORM ENGINEER creates the ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
- The RPA contains release pipeline credentials and is kept in a restricted, controlled namespace

Here's a practical example from the skill:

```
In Tenant Namespace (you create):
- ReleasePlan: "prod-release-plan"
  - Points to Application
  - References target workspace

In Managed Namespace (Platform Engineer creates):
- ReleasePlanAdmission: "prod-admission"
  - Contains production credentials
  - Defines release pipeline
```

This separation ensures that sensitive release credentials are isolated from development teams while still allowing developers to request releases.
