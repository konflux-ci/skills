Based on the "Understanding Konflux Resources" guide, you do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

The RPA is specifically created by the **Platform Engineer**, not by the application developer. It is placed in the **managed namespace** and contains release pipeline credentials and configuration.

Here's the key information from the reference:

| Resource | Who Creates | Namespace | Key Point |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) | Platform Engineer | **Managed** | Contains secrets |

As a developer, your role is to:
1. Create a ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
2. Request the platform team to create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace

This separation ensures that:
- Developers can request releases
- Sensitive credentials remain isolated in a controlled namespace
- Platform engineers manage access and security for release pipelines

So to directly answer your question: No, you do not create the RPA. That's the responsibility of the platform engineering team.
