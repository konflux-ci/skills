No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) directly. In Konflux, ReleasePlanAdmissions are usually created automatically by the system based on the ReleasePlan and the application's configuration. 

Here's a brief overview:
- The ReleasePlan is created by users or the system
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is then automatically generated by Konflux
- The RPA represents the admission of a specific release into a particular environment

The RPA is essentially an automated resource that validates and manages the release process, checking if the release meets the necessary criteria for deployment. It's part of Konflux's automated release management workflow, which helps ensure consistent and controlled deployments.

If you're working with Konflux and want to understand or interact with RPAs, you'll typically:
1. Create a ReleasePlan
2. Let the system generate the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission
3. Review or interact with the automatically created RPA

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of ReleasePlanAdmissions in Konflux?
