No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself. In Konflux, the RPA is usually automatically created by the system based on the ReleasePlan (RP) and the current state of your application and components.

Here's a brief breakdown:
- ReleasePlan (RP): This is created by you or your team to define the release strategy
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA): This is automatically generated by Konflux based on the ReleasePlan
- The RPA represents the system's assessment and admission of whether a release can proceed, taking into account various checks and conditions

The RPA is essentially an automated resource that determines if the release meets all the necessary criteria defined in the ReleasePlan. It's a way for Konflux to manage and validate the release process automatically.

If you want to understand more about the specifics of how RPAs are created and managed in your specific Konflux setup, I recommend checking your project's specific configuration or consulting with your team's DevOps/platform engineering team.
