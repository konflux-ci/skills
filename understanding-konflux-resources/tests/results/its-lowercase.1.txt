To help diagnose the issue, I'll need more information. Could you provide:
1. The name of your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS)
2. The namespace where it's deployed
3. The output of the following kubectl commands:
   - `kubectl get its -n <your-namespace>`
   - `kubectl describe its <its-name> -n <your-namespace>`

These details will help me understand why your ITS isn't triggering after builds. Some common reasons could be:
- Incorrect configuration in the ITS spec
- Missing snapshots
- Permission or role binding issues
- Misconfigured build pipeline

Please share the requested information, and I'll help you troubleshoot the problem step by step.
