Based on the diagnostic results, I've outlined several potential reasons why your Konflux pipeline might not be triggering after builds. The most common causes include:

1. Misconfigured pipeline annotations
2. Incorrect pipeline or trigger references
3. Resource quota or permission issues
4. Misconfigured webhooks
5. Broken build-pipeline linkage

To help diagnose this precisely, I need you to provide:
- The contents of your `.tekton/` directory
- Recent build logs
- Output of `oc get pipelineruns` and `oc describe component`
- Any specific error messages you've encountered

Could you share those details so I can help you pinpoint and resolve the pipeline trigger issue?
