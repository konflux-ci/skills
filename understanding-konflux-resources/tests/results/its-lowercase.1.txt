I've outlined several potential reasons why your integration tests might not be triggering after builds. To help diagnose this more precisely, I'll need some additional information from you:

1. Can you confirm the specific trigger conditions for your integration tests?
2. Have there been any recent changes to your Konflux pipeline configuration?
3. Are you able to share the relevant configuration files (with sensitive information redacted)?
4. What specific error messages or logs have you seen?

Some quick things you can check:
- Verify the pipeline configuration in your `.konflux.yaml` or similar files
- Check the Konflux dashboard for any error messages or skipped test indications
- Use `tkn pipeline list` and `tkn pipelinerun list` to see recent pipeline runs

Would you like me to help you investigate further by walking you through some diagnostic steps?
