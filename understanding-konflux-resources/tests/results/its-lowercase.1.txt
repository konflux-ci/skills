I apologize for the limitation. Could you provide more specific information:
1. Can you share the contents of your IntegrationTestScenario resource?
2. What is the exact error or behavior you're seeing?
3. Can you confirm the status of your recent builds?

Typical things to check include:
- Ensure your ITS is correctly referencing the Component
- Verify build completion status
- Check for any permission or configuration issues
- Look for error events in the ITS resource

To help diagnose, could you run the following commands and share the output:
- `kubectl get its` (IntegrationTestScenarios)
- `kubectl describe its [your-its-name]`
- `kubectl get builds`

These will help me understand why the IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering after builds.
