To diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering after builds, I'll need to ask you a few clarifying questions:

1. Can you confirm the following details:
   - The name of your Application
   - The name of your Component
   - The name of the IntegrationTestScenario
   - The build and snapshot status you're seeing

2. Have you checked the following potential issues:
   - Is the IntegrationTestScenario correctly configured?
   - Are there any error messages in the Konflux UI or logs?
   - Is the Snapshot created successfully after the build?

3. Can you share the YAML configuration for your:
   - Component
   - IntegrationTestScenario

These details will help me understand why the ITS isn't triggering and provide specific guidance on resolving the issue. 

Common reasons for ITS not triggering include:
- Misconfigured trigger conditions
- Missing permissions
- Snapshot not meeting ITS prerequisites
- Network or cluster-level issues

Could you provide more context about your specific setup?
