I apologize, but I cannot fully diagnose the issue without more specific information about your Konflux pipeline. The konflux-pipeline-debugger agent needs context about your specific configuration.

To help me investigate why your pipeline isn't triggering after builds, I need you to provide:

1. **Specific Details:**
   - The name of your Konflux application/component
   - Any error messages you've seen
   - Recent build logs or pipeline run names

2. **Configuration Information:**
   - Are you using a custom `.tekton/` directory?
   - Have there been any recent changes to your pipeline configuration?

3. **Environment Context:**
   - Are you using OpenShift or another Kubernetes platform?
   - Do you have access to `kubectl` or `oc` commands?

Possible reasons for pipeline not triggering could include:
- Misconfigured triggers
- Permission issues
- Resource constraints
- Recent changes in build or pipeline configuration

Could you provide more details about your specific setup? The more information you can share, the more precisely I can help you diagnose and resolve the issue.
