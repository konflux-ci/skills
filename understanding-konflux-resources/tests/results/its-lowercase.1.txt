To help me provide more precise guidance, I'll need more information from you:

1. Can you share the contents of your IntegrationTestScenario YAML?
2. What is the specific application and component you're working with?
3. Have you checked the Konflux cluster logs for any error messages related to the ITS?
4. Are there any specific error messages or behavior you're observing?

The key areas to investigate are:
- Correct snapshot references
- Proper permissions for the ITS
- Resolver configuration
- Trigger conditions

Would you like to provide more details so I can help you diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering?
