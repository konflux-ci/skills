Based on the comprehensive troubleshooting guide, here are the key steps to diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) isn't triggering after builds:

1. **Namespace Verification**
   ```bash
   kubectl get its -n <your-tenant-namespace>
   ```
   - Confirm your ITS exists in the CORRECT namespace
   - Ensure it's in the tenant namespace, NOT the managed namespace

2. **Snapshot Validation**
   ```bash
   kubectl get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>
   ```
   - Verify snapshots are being created after builds
   - Check if the ITS references the correct Application/Components

3. **Common Reasons ITS Might Not Run:
   - ❌ Incorrect namespace for ITS
   - ❌ No snapshots generated
   - ❌ Misconfigured pipeline references
   - ❌ Insufficient permissions
   - ❌ ITS not linked to your Application

4. **Detailed Diagnostics**
   ```bash
   # Describe your snapshot to check its status
   kubectl describe snapshot <snapshot-name> -n <your-tenant-namespace>

   # Check ITS details
   kubectl describe its <its-name> -n <your-tenant-namespace>
   ```

5. **Verification Checklist**
   - [ ] ITS is in tenant namespace
   - [ ] Snapshot exists after build
   - [ ] Pipeline referenced by ITS is valid
   - [ ] Service account has required permissions
   - [ ] ITS correctly references your Application

Would you like me to help you go through these diagnostic steps? Could you provide:
1. The namespace you're using
2. The name of your IntegrationTestScenario
3. The output of `kubectl get snapshots` and `kubectl get its`

This will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS isn't triggering.
