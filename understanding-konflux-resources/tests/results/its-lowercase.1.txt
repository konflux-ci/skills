Based on the comprehensive diagnostic guide, I recommend you go through these specific troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify ITS Namespace
   ```bash
   oc get integrationtestscenario -n <your-tenant-namespace>
   ```

2. Check Snapshot Creation
   ```bash
   oc get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>
   ```

3. Examine Build Status
   ```bash
   oc get builds -n <your-tenant-namespace>
   ```

Can you run these commands and share the output? This will help me pinpoint exactly why your IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering. 

Specific things I'll be looking for:
- Are snapshots being created after builds?
- Is your ITS in the correct namespace?
- Do the builds complete successfully?

Would you like to proceed with these diagnostic steps?
