To help you troubleshoot, I'll provide a correct IntegrationTestScenario example:

```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: my-integration-tests
  namespace: <your-tenant-namespace>
spec:
  application: <your-application-name>
  resolverRef:
    # This references the Tekton pipeline that runs your tests
    resolver: cluster
    params:
      - name: kind
        value: pipeline
      - name: name
        value: my-test-pipeline  # Name of your test Tekton pipeline
      - name: namespace
        value: <your-tenant-namespace>
  # Optional: Specific conditions to trigger tests
  testSpec:
    # Example conditions
    trigger:
      - type: new-snapshot
    # Optional: Specify which components to test
    components:
      - name: my-component-name
```

Key things to check:
1. Is your ITS in the tenant namespace? 
2. Does it reference the correct Application?
3. Does the referenced Tekton pipeline exist?
4. Are there any restrictions preventing test triggering?

Could you provide:
1. The namespace of your IntegrationTestScenario
2. The Application it's associated with
3. The Tekton pipeline it references

This will help me diagnose why your ITS isn't triggering after builds.
