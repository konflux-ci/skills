Could you provide more details about your specific setup?
- Can you share the output of `oc get its`?
- What are the exact names of your application, component, and IntegrationTestScenario?
- Did you recently make any changes to your configuration?

Knowing these details will help me more precisely diagnose why your ITS isn't triggering after builds.
