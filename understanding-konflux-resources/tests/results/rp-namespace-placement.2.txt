I apologize for the temporary limitation. Based on my understanding of Konflux resources, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. Here's a breakdown:

- **Tenant Namespace**: This is where you should create your ReleasePlan (RP)
- Managed Namespace: This is used for actual deployment and running of components, not for creating RPs

The typical workflow is:
1. Create your ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace
2. The ReleasePlan will then be processed and potentially create resources in the managed namespace

If you want to confirm the exact details for your specific Konflux setup, I recommend:
1. Checking with your Konflux administrator
2. Reviewing your specific cluster's configuration
3. Consulting the Konflux documentation for your specific version

Would you like me to help you locate more specific documentation about ReleasePlan placement in Konflux?
