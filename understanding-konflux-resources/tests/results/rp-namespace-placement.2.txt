Let me help you understand the namespace placement for ReleasePlans in Konflux:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where you manage your application-level resources
2. ReleasePlans are associated with the overall application and its release strategy
3. They are created and managed by the application team (tenant users)

The managed namespace, in contrast, is usually used for:
- Storing runtime artifacts
- Hosting deployed snapshots
- Managing actual deployments

So, to directly answer your question: Create your ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace. This allows you to define your release strategy at the application level, while the actual deployment artifacts and processes will be handled in the managed namespace.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of ReleasePlan creation or namespace usage in Konflux?
