I'll provide a detailed explanation based on Konflux best practices:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:

1. The tenant namespace is where you have direct control and management of your application's resources.
2. ReleasePlans are user-created resources that define how and when a component should be released.
3. The managed namespace is primarily used for storing generated resources like Snapshots and ReleasePlanAdmissions (RPAs).

The typical workflow is:
- Create your ReleasePlan (RP) in the tenant namespace
- Konflux will then automatically create corresponding ReleasePlanAdmissions (RPAs) in the managed namespace

This separation of concerns allows for:
- Clear resource management
- Automated release processes
- Proper tracking of release workflows

If you're unsure about the specific namespace for your use case, I recommend:
1. Consulting your Konflux cluster administrator
2. Checking your specific Konflux configuration
3. Creating the ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace as the default approach

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or provide more context about ReleasePlans in Konflux?
