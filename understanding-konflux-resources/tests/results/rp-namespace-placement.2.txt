I'll help you understand the correct namespace for your ReleasePlan (RP).

Let me use the understanding-konflux-resources skill to provide a clear explanation:

ReleasePlan (RP) goes in the TENANT namespace. 

Here's a quick breakdown:
- ✅ ReleasePlan: Created by YOU in YOUR tenant namespace
- ❌ NOT in managed namespace

The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA), which contains release pipeline credentials, goes in the MANAGED namespace. This separation ensures:
1. You control the release plan
2. Platform engineers manage sensitive credentials

So the workflow is:
1. You create ReleasePlan in tenant namespace
2. Platform engineer creates corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in managed namespace

Common mistake to avoid: Don't put your ReleasePlan in the managed namespace. That's not where it belongs, and you won't have the necessary permissions.

Would you like me to elaborate on the relationship between ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission?
