Based on the detailed skill information, I can directly answer your question about ReleasePlan (RP) placement in Konflux:

**ReleasePlan (RP) goes in the TENANT namespace, NOT the managed namespace.**

Key points:
- You (the application owner) create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
- The ReleasePlan references your Application and describes the release action
- Platform Engineers will create a corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace, which contains the actual release credentials and pipeline details

So to summarize:
- ✅ ReleasePlan: Created by you, goes in TENANT namespace
- 🔒 ReleasePlanAdmission: Created by Platform Engineer, goes in MANAGED namespace

The two resources work together across different namespaces, with the RPA referencing your tenant-namespace ReleasePlan and providing the necessary release pipeline configuration and credentials.

Would you like me to elaborate on how these two resources interact in the release workflow?
