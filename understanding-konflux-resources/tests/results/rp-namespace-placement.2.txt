I apologize for the persistent error. Since I cannot directly search the web, I'll provide some general guidance based on typical Konflux and OpenShift practices:

In Konflux, pull requests (PRs) are typically created in the managed namespace. The managed namespace is specifically designed to handle build and deployment processes for your application. Here's a breakdown:

1. Managed Namespace:
   - This is the primary namespace where your application builds and deployments are processed
   - Provides isolation and security for your application's CI/CD pipeline
   - Recommended location for creating pull requests and running builds

2. Tenant Namespace:
   - Usually used for broader organizational or team-level configurations
   - Not typically the primary location for individual application PRs

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information specific to your Konflux setup, I recommend:
1. Consulting your team's specific Konflux configuration guidelines
2. Checking with your platform engineering or DevOps team
3. Reviewing the Konflux documentation for your specific implementation

Would you like me to help you verify the correct namespace for your specific use case? If you can provide more context about your specific Konflux setup, I can offer more precise guidance.
