Based on the understanding-konflux-resources skill, I can provide a clear answer:

Your **ReleasePlan (RP)** should be created in the **TENANT NAMESPACE**.

This is a common point of confusion, so let me break it down:

❌ WRONG: Put ReleasePlan in managed namespace
✅ CORRECT: ReleasePlan goes in YOUR tenant namespace

The key differences are:
- ReleasePlan (RP): Created by you (application owner) in TENANT namespace
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA): Created by Platform Engineer in MANAGED namespace

The tenant namespace ReleasePlan points to your Application and defines the release action, while the managed namespace ReleasePlanAdmission contains the actual credentials and pipeline details.

This separation ensures:
1. You control the release plan for your application
2. Sensitive credentials remain isolated in the managed namespace
3. Clear separation of responsibilities between dev teams and platform teams

Would you like me to elaborate on the namespace placement or ReleasePlan creation process?
