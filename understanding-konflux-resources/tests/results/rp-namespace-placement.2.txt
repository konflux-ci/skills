Based on the skill information, I can directly answer your question about ReleasePlan (RP) placement in Konflux:

**ReleasePlan (RP) should be created in the TENANT namespace.**

Key points to remember:
- You (as the application owner) create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created by the Platform Engineer in the managed namespace
- These two resources work together across different namespaces

The workflow is:
1. You create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Platform Engineer creates a corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. The ReleasePlanAdmission references your ReleasePlan and contains the necessary release credentials

A common mistake is thinking the ReleasePlan should go in the managed namespace - this is incorrect. Always create your ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or help you understand how to create a ReleasePlan?
