I apologize for the error. Let me provide guidance based on my understanding of Konflux resource management:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RP) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where you manage your application-specific resources
2. ReleasePlans are specific to your application's release process
3. They define how and when your application components will be released

The managed namespace is generally used for:
- Snapshots
- IntegrationTestScenarios (ITS)
- Actual deployed artifacts

So, to directly answer your question: You should create your ReleasePlan (RP) in the **tenant namespace**.

If you want to confirm the exact details for your specific Konflux setup, I recommend:
1. Checking with your Konflux administrator
2. Reviewing your cluster's specific configuration
3. Consulting your organization's specific Konflux resource management guidelines

Would you like me to help you create or understand more about your ReleasePlan configuration?
