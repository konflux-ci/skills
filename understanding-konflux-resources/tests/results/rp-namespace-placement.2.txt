Let me provide some guidance about ReleasePlan placement in Konflux:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is the namespace specific to your team or project, where you manage your application resources.

Key points:
- ReleasePlans should be created in the tenant namespace
- The managed namespace is used for storing build artifacts and system-managed resources
- Creating the ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace allows your team to have direct control over the release process
- This approach ensures proper separation of concerns between user-managed and system-managed resources

If you're unsure about your specific tenant namespace, you can typically:
1. Check with your Konflux administrator
2. Look for the namespace where your other Konflux resources (like Applications and Components) are created
3. Use the `oc get namespaces` command to identify your tenant namespace

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the ReleasePlan placement in Konflux?
