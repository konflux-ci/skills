I apologize for the error. Let me provide some guidance based on my understanding of Konflux resources:

ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This is because:
1. The tenant namespace is where users define their application-specific resources
2. ReleasePlans are user-managed resources that describe how and when to release a particular version of an application
3. The managed namespace is primarily used for system-generated resources and automated processes

To create a ReleasePlan:
- Use the tenant namespace associated with your application
- Ensure the ReleasePlan references the specific Component and Application you want to release
- The ReleasePlan will trigger the release process in the managed namespace, but its definition lives in the tenant namespace

If you're unsure about your specific tenant namespace, you can:
- Check your Konflux application configuration
- Consult with your cluster administrator
- Use the `oc get namespaces` command to list available namespaces

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation about ReleasePlan namespace placement?
