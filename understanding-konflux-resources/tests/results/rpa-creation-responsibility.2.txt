No, in Konflux, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself. 

The RPA is automatically created by the Konflux system as part of the release process. It's a resource that represents the admission or approval of a ReleasePlan. The system generates this resource based on the existing ReleasePlan and the current state of your application components.

Key points:
- ReleasePlan is created by the user
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is automatically generated by the system
- RPAs help manage the release process and track approvals
- They are typically created in the managed namespace, not the user's tenant namespace

If you want to understand more about the release process in Konflux, I recommend checking the Konflux documentation or consulting with your team's DevOps engineers who are familiar with the specific implementation of release workflows in your environment.
