I apologize for the inconvenience. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux and continuous integration workflows:

In Konflux, the RPA (Repository Preconfiguration Action) is typically created and managed by the platform itself as part of the initial repository setup. You don't manually create the RPA. Instead, when you:

1. Connect a repository to Konflux
2. Set up a new application in the Konflux interface
3. Configure your build pipeline

Konflux automatically generates and manages the RPA for you. The platform handles the preconfiguration of your repository, setting up the necessary actions, workflows, and configurations to enable continuous integration and deployment.

Key points:
- You don't manually create the RPA
- Konflux automatically generates it during repository integration
- The RPA is part of the platform's built-in repository configuration process

If you want to verify or view the specific RPA for your project, I recommend:
- Checking the Konflux web interface
- Reviewing your repository's configuration settings
- Consulting with your team's DevOps or platform engineering team

Would you like me to help you understand more about how RPAs work in the Konflux pipeline?
