No, you do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself. In Konflux, the RPA is typically created automatically by the system based on the Release Plan (RP) and the current state of your application and components.

Here's a brief breakdown:
- Release Plan (RP): You create this to define your release strategy
- Release Plan Admission (RPA): This is automatically generated by Konflux
  - It represents the system's assessment of whether the release plan can be admitted (approved)
  - The system evaluates factors like build status, test results, and other readiness criteria

The RPA is essentially a system-generated resource that validates whether your release plan meets all the necessary requirements for progression. You don't manually create it - instead, it's an outcome of your Release Plan and the current state of your application's components and tests.

If you want to understand more about the RPA or influence its creation, focus on:
1. Creating a well-defined Release Plan
2. Ensuring your components pass all required tests
3. Maintaining the overall health of your application in the Konflux CI/CD pipeline
