Based on the Konflux Resources guide I just reviewed, you do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

From the "Understanding Konflux Resources" section:

**Who Creates ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA):** Platform Engineer

**Namespace:** Managed namespace (NOT tenant namespace)

The key points are:
- RPA contains release pipeline credentials
- It is created by the platform engineering team
- It goes in the managed namespace, which is restricted and controlled by the platform team

So if you're a developer or application owner, you would:
1. Create a ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
2. Request a Platform Engineer to create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace

This separation ensures that sensitive release credentials are isolated from development teams while still allowing developers to request and manage releases.

Would you like me to elaborate on the relationship between ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission?
