No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself in Konflux. 

The ReleasePlanAdmission is usually created automatically by the Konflux system as part of the release process. It's a resource that represents the admission of a specific ReleasePlan, which helps manage and validate the release of components.

To provide more context:
- The ReleasePlan is usually created by you or your team
- The ReleasePlanAdmission is then automatically generated by the system to validate and process that release plan
- It helps ensure that the release meets certain criteria and can proceed

If you need to work with RPAs, you'll typically:
1. Create a ReleasePlan
2. Let Konflux generate the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission
3. Review and manage the RPA through Konflux's interfaces

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlans and ReleasePlanAdmissions work in Konflux?
