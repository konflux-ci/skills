No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself in Konflux. The RPA is usually automatically created by the system based on the ReleasePlan and the current state of your Application and Components.

Here's a brief breakdown:
- You create a ReleasePlan
- Konflux's admission controller automatically generates the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)
- The RPA represents the admission of your release plan, checking if it meets the necessary criteria and can be processed

The RPA is a system-managed resource that validates and tracks the admission of your release plan, ensuring it meets the required conditions before proceeding with the release process.

If you want to understand more about the specific details of how RPAs are created and managed in Konflux, I recommend checking the official Konflux documentation or consulting with your team's platform engineers.
