Based on the skill output, I can definitively answer your question:

No, you do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

**The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created by the Platform Engineer in the managed namespace.** 

Key points:
- You create the ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
- The Platform Engineer creates the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace
- RPAs are NOT automatically created by Konflux
- RPAs contain release pipeline credentials and are manually set up by your platform team

So if you want an RPA, you'll need to work with your platform engineering team to have them create it in the managed namespace, referencing the ReleasePlan you create in your tenant namespace.
