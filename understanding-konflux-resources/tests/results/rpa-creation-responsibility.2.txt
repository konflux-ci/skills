No, in Konflux, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself. Let me explain:

The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is usually automatically created by the Konflux system based on the ReleasePlan (RP) and the current state of your application components. It's an automated resource that represents the system's assessment and approval of a release plan.

Here's a breakdown:
- You create the ReleasePlan (RP)
- The system automatically generates the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)
- The RPA reflects whether the release plan can be implemented based on various checks and validations

So, to directly answer your question: No, you do not manually create the RPA. It is generated automatically by the Konflux CI/CD system as part of the release process.

If you need more specific details about how RPAs are created or what they represent in your specific workflow, I recommend consulting your Konflux project's documentation or speaking with your team's DevOps engineer who can provide context specific to your implementation.
