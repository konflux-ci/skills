I'll provide a detailed answer using the understanding-konflux-resources skill.

According to the resource breakdown, **the platform engineer creates the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)**. 

Specifically, from the "Quick Reference" table:
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created by "Platform Engineer"
- It is placed in the **Managed** namespace
- Contains release pipeline credentials

The key distinction is:
- YOU (as a developer/user) create the ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
- The PLATFORM TEAM creates the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace

This separation ensures that:
- Developers can request releases
- Sensitive credentials remain isolated
- Platform teams control release pipeline access

Example workflow:
1. You create a ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Platform engineer creates corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in managed namespace
3. This allows you to trigger releases while keeping credentials secure

So to directly answer your question: The platform team creates the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA), not you.
