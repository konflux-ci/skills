Based on the skill information, I can directly answer your question:

No, you do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is specifically created by the Platform Engineer in the managed namespace. It is NOT:
- Auto-created by Konflux
- Something you create in your tenant namespace
- Automatically generated by the release service

To break it down:
- YOU create the ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
- The PLATFORM ENGINEER creates the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace

The RPA contains release pipeline credentials and works together with your ReleasePlan across different namespaces. This separation ensures that sensitive release credentials are kept isolated from development teams while still allowing developers to request releases.

Would you like me to elaborate on the relationship between ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission, or explain how they work together in the Konflux workflow?
