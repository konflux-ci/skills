No, you typically do not create the RPA (ReleasePlanAdmission) yourself. In the Konflux workflow:

- The ReleasePlan (RP) is created first, usually by a release manager or a team responsible for release planning.
- The RPA is automatically created by the Konflux system based on the ReleasePlan.

Specifically:
- The ReleasePlan defines the release parameters and criteria
- Konflux's system then automatically generates the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)
- The RPA represents the actual admission of a specific component or snapshot into the release process

So, to directly answer your question: No, you do not manually create the RPA. It is automatically generated by Konflux based on the ReleasePlan you've set up.

Would you like me to elaborate on the relationship between ReleasePlans and ReleasePlanAdmissions in more detail?
