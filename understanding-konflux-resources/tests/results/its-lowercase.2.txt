I apologize for the error. Let me provide some general troubleshooting steps for Konflux ITS not triggering:

1. Verify ITS Configuration:
   - Check that your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is correctly configured
   - Ensure the ITS is linked to the correct Component and Application
   - Confirm the trigger conditions are met

2. Check Snapshot Creation:
   - Verify that a Snapshot was successfully created after your build
   - An ITS typically requires a valid Snapshot to trigger

3. Validate Resource Relationships:
   - Confirm that:
     - Your Component is part of the correct Application
     - The ITS references the correct Component
     - Necessary labels and annotations are present

4. Inspect Logs and Events:
   ```bash
   # Check ITS status
   oc get its

   # Describe the specific ITS to see any error messages
   oc describe its <its-name>

   # Check related Snapshots
   oc get snapshots

   # Look for any error events
   oc get events
   ```

5. Common Reasons for Non-Triggering:
   - Incorrect permissions
   - Missing labels
   - Misconfigured trigger conditions
   - Build not completing successfully
   - Network or cluster issues

Would you like me to help you investigate further? I can assist you by:
- Examining specific configuration details
- Running diagnostic commands
- Reviewing your ITS and Snapshot configurations

Could you provide more context:
- Can you share the output of `oc get its`?
- Do you see any error messages when describing the ITS?
- What are the trigger conditions for your IntegrationTestScenario?
