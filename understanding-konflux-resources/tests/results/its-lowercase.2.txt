To help diagnose the issue, I'll need more information:
1. Can you share the output of the following commands:
   - `oc get snapshots`
   - `oc get integrationtestscenarios`
   - `oc describe its [your-its-name]`

2. Provide details about:
   - Your Component's build status
   - The specific ITS you're expecting to trigger
   - Any error messages or logs you've seen

Could you run those commands and share the output? This will help me pinpoint why your ITS isn't triggering after builds.

A few quick checks I recommend:
- Ensure your ITS is correctly labeled to match the Snapshot
- Check that the ITS has the right `spec.resolveBuilds` configuration
- Verify there are no permission issues preventing the test from starting
