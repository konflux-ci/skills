To help diagnose the issue, I'll need some more information from you:

1. Can you confirm the following details:
   - Are you using the Konflux web interface or CLI?
   - Have integration tests worked before, or is this a new setup?
   - Do you see any error messages or logs indicating why tests aren't triggering?

2. Please check and provide:
   - The contents of your `.tekton` directory (if it exists)
   - Your build configuration in the Konflux console
   - Any recent build logs or pipeline run history

Some common reasons why integration tests might not trigger:
- Misconfigured pipeline definitions
- Missing test stage in the build pipeline
- Incorrect trigger conditions
- Permissions or configuration issues
- Tests marked as optional or skipped

Could you provide more context about your specific Konflux setup and the integration test configuration? The more details you can share, the better I can help you diagnose and resolve the issue.
