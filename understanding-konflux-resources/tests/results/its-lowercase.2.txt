I apologize for the error. Could you provide me with:
1. Your tenant namespace name
2. The name of your IntegrationTestScenario
3. The name of your Application that the ITS is associated with

I'll help you verify:
- If Snapshots are being created
- If the ITS is configured correctly
- Why the tests might not be triggering

Typical reasons for ITS not triggering include:
- Incorrect namespace
- No Snapshot created (build failed)
- ITS not referencing the correct Application
- Missing permissions
- Tekton pipeline issues

Could you share more details about your specific setup?
