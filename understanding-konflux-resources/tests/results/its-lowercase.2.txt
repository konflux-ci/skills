I've prepared a comprehensive diagnostic framework to help you understand why your Integrated Tests (ITS) aren't triggering after builds in Konflux. The investigation requires more context from you.

To proceed, I need you to provide:
1. The path to your repository
2. The Konflux namespace where your application is deployed
3. Any error logs or recent pipeline run details you've observed

A few key questions that will help diagnose the issue:
- Have you previously had successful ITS runs?
- Did anything change recently in your pipeline configuration?
- Are you seeing any specific error messages?

The diagnostic framework I've outlined covers several common reasons why ITS might not trigger:
- Misconfigured IntegrationTestScenario
- Missing pipeline annotations
- Snapshot creation problems
- Application and component configuration issues
- Build service controller problems
- Conditional execution blocks
- Event listener misconfigurations

Please provide the additional context, and I'll help you pinpoint and resolve the ITS triggering issue.
