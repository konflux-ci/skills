Based on the comprehensive diagnostic guide, I can help you troubleshoot why your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) isn't triggering. However, to provide the most accurate assistance, I'll need a bit more information from you:

1. Can you share the output of `kubectl get its -n <your-namespace>`?
2. Can you show me the YAML of your IntegrationTestScenario?
3. Can you confirm the namespace where your Application, Component, and IntegrationTestScenario are located?

A few quick things to check:
- Verify the ITS is in the SAME namespace as your Application
- Confirm that Snapshots are being created after your builds
- Check that your Tekton pipeline is properly configured

Would you like to provide those details so I can help you diagnose the specific issue?
