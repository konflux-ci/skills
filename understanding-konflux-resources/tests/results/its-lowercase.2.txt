I see that to diagnose your Konflux Image Trigger Service (ITS) issue, I'll need more specific information from you. Could you please provide:

1. The absolute path to your project directory
2. The namespace you're working in
3. The name of your application/component
4. If possible, the output of the diagnostic commands I suggested, particularly:
   - Recent PipelineRun details
   - IntegrationTestScenario configurations
   - Component definitions

Some quick questions to help narrow down the issue:
- Did the build pipeline complete successfully?
- Do you see any error messages when you check the pipeline or trigger logs?
- Have you verified that the image was successfully pushed to the repository?

The most common reasons for Image Triggers not working include:
- Missing image digest annotations
- Label selector mismatches
- Authentication/access problems with the image repository
- Snapshot creation failures
- Incorrect component configuration

I'm ready to help you troubleshoot and get your Image Trigger working correctly.
