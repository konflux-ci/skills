Based on the Konflux resources skill, here's a systematic troubleshooting guide for why your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) isn't triggering after builds:

### 1. Verify ITS Configuration
- Ensure your IntegrationTestScenario is correctly configured
- Check that it references the correct Application
- Verify the Snapshot and Component labels match

### 2. Common Reasons ITS Doesn't Trigger

❌ WRONG: Assuming ITS automatically runs on every build
✅ CORRECT: ITS requires specific configuration to trigger

Potential Issues:
1. Incorrect Application Reference
2. Mismatched Labels
3. Tekton Pipeline Problems
4. Insufficient Permissions
5. Snapshot Not Created Properly

### 3. Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# List IntegrationTestScenarios
kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-tenant-namespace>

# Describe specific ITS to check configuration
kubectl describe integrationtestscenario <its-name> -n <your-tenant-namespace>

# List Snapshots to verify they're being created
kubectl get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>
```

### 4. Checklist for ITS Configuration

- [ ] ITS points to correct Application
- [ ] Snapshot exists after build
- [ ] Tekton pipeline referenced by ITS is valid
- [ ] Permissions allow test execution
- [ ] Labels match between Component, Snapshot, and ITS

### 5. Common Fixes

**Label Matching**
- Ensure your ITS has correct label selectors
- Match Application and Component labels exactly

**Example ITS Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: my-test-scenario
spec:
  application: my-application
  resolverRef:
    url: # Tekton pipeline URL
  testContainer:
    # Test container configuration
```

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Verify Snapshot creation after build
2. Check ITS description for any error messages
3. Review Tekton pipeline logs
4. Confirm you have necessary permissions
