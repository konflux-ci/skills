To help diagnose the issue, I'll need more information. Could you provide:
1. The name of your Integration Test Scenario (ITS)
2. The name of your Application and Component
3. Any error messages or logs you've seen
4. Confirm that a Snapshot was created after your build

Common reasons why an ITS might not trigger include:
- Misconfigured trigger conditions
- Missing Snapshot
- Permissions issues
- ITS not matching the build/snapshot criteria

Let's start by investigating the most likely causes. Can you share more details about your specific setup so I can help you pinpoint why the ITS isn't triggering?

To give you a quick overview, in Konflux:
- A Build creates a Component image
- A Snapshot is created from that Build
- An ITS is typically triggered based on specific conditions related to the Snapshot

I've added some initial investigation tasks to the todo list, and I'm ready to help you troubleshoot systematically.
