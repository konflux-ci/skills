I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me help you troubleshoot why your Integration Test Scenario (ITS) isn't triggering after builds. Here are some common reasons and steps to investigate:

1. Check IntegrationTestScenario Configuration
   - Verify that your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is correctly configured
   - Ensure it's linked to the correct Component
   - Check that the spec.resolveWhen conditions are met

2. Validate Build and Snapshot Status
   - Confirm that your Build and Snapshot are in a successful state
   - The ITS typically triggers based on Snapshot creation

3. Check Logs and Events
   - Inspect the logs of your Component, Build, Snapshot, and IntegrationTestScenario
   - Look for any error messages or reasons why the test might not be triggering

Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Verify the ITS configuration:
```bash
# List your IntegrationTestScenarios
oc get integrationtestscenarios

# Describe the specific ITS to check its configuration
oc describe integrationtestscenario [its-name]
```

2. Check the recent Snapshots:
```bash
# List Snapshots
oc get snapshots

# Describe a specific Snapshot to understand its status
oc describe snapshot [snapshot-name]
```

3. Check Build and Component status:
```bash
# List Builds
oc get builds

# List Components
oc get components
```

Questions to help diagnose:
1. Can you share the output of these commands?
2. Did you recently make any changes to your ITS configuration?
3. Are there any specific error messages you're seeing?
4. What is the exact configuration of your IntegrationTestScenario?

Would you like to provide more details so I can help you pinpoint why the ITS isn't triggering?
