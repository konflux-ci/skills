I apologize for the error. Let me provide information based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references a ReleasePlan (RP) through a specific reference mechanism. The RPA needs to reference the specific ReleasePlan it is associated with. 

Regarding the namespace:
- The RPA and RP do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. 
- However, the RPA must include a reference to the ReleasePlan, typically using the name and namespace of the ReleasePlan it is admitting.

The typical structure would look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlanAdmission
metadata:
  name: my-rpa
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  releasePlan:
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: source-namespace
  # Other RPA-specific configurations
```

Key points:
1. The RPA can be in a different namespace from the ReleasePlan it references
2. The reference is made explicit in the RPA's spec section
3. The reference includes both the name and namespace of the original ReleasePlan

To get the most up-to-date and precise information, I recommend:
1. Checking the current Konflux documentation
2. Reviewing the latest Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission
3. Consulting with the Konflux team for any recent changes in resource relationships

Would you like me to help you find more specific, current documentation about this relationship?
