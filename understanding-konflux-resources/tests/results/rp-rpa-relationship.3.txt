I apologize for the error. Let me explain based on my understanding of Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a Release Plan Admission (RPA) references a Release Plan (RP), and they typically need to be in the same namespace. The RPA is created as an admission process for a specific Release Plan, which means:

1. The RPA must explicitly reference the RP it is associated with
2. They are usually created in the same namespace to maintain a clear relationship
3. The RPA validates and potentially modifies the Release Plan before it can be implemented

The reference is typically done through a spec field in the RPA that points to the specific Release Plan's name and namespace.

For the most up-to-date and precise information, I recommend:
- Checking the Konflux documentation
- Reviewing the specific Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for RPA and RP
- Consulting with your Konflux cluster administrator or checking the actual resource definitions in your cluster

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about how RPAs and RPs are linked in Konflux?
