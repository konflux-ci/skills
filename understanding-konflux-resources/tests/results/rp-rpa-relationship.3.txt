I apologize, but I'm unable to directly fetch the documentation due to tool access restrictions. However, based on my existing knowledge about Konflux and release pipelines:

In Konflux, the Release Pipeline Artifact (RPA) and Release Pipeline (RP) typically reference each other, but they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. The key points are:

1. The RPA is a custom resource that represents the artifact produced by a Release Pipeline.
2. The RP (Release Pipeline) can create and reference RPAs across different namespaces.
3. The reference is usually done through specific label selectors or annotations that link the RP to its corresponding RPA.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
1. Checking the Konflux documentation at https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.html
2. Consulting the Konflux GitHub repository for the most recent specifications
3. Verifying with the Konflux team or community if you need precise details about namespace requirements

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about this relationship?
