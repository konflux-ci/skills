Given the limitations in finding a definitive answer, I suggest a few practical steps:

1. The relationship between RPA and RP might depend on your specific Konflux configuration.
2. Namespace requirements can vary, but typically in Kubernetes-based systems:
   - Annotations often reference resources across different namespaces
   - There might be specific rules about cross-namespace references

To get a definitive answer, I recommend:
- Checking the Konflux documentation
- Reviewing your specific cluster configuration
- Consulting with your DevOps team or Konflux administrators

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about how RPAs reference RPs in your specific Konflux setup? If you can provide more context about your specific use case or configuration, I can offer more targeted guidance.
