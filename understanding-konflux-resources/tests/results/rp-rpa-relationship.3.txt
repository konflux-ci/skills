To directly answer your questions:
1. **How does the RPA reference the RP?**
   - The RPA references the RP through matching names/labels
   - The RPA explicitly includes a reference to the ReleasePlan in its specification
   - They use a consistent naming convention that links them together

2. **Do they need to be in the same namespace?**
   - **No, they do NOT need to be in the same namespace**
   - In fact, they are intentionally placed in DIFFERENT namespaces:
     - ReleasePlan (RP) is in the TENANT namespace
     - ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is in the MANAGED namespace

This design allows for a clear separation of concerns between application developers (who define the release strategy) and platform engineers (who manage the release implementation and credentials).
