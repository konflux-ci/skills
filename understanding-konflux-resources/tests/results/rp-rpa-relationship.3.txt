Let me help you understand the relationship between ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) and ReleaseProject (RP) in Konflux:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleaseProject (RP), and they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. Typically:

1. The RPA references the ReleaseProject (RP) through a specific field in its specification.
2. The reference is usually made using the name and namespace of the ReleaseProject.
3. While they can be in different namespaces, they are often related and can be in the same namespace depending on the specific deployment configuration.

The key point is that the RPA contains a reference to the RP, allowing it to interact with or validate the release plan across different namespaces if needed.

To get more specific details about their relationship, I recommend:
1. Checking the specific CRD (Custom Resource Definition) for ReleasePlanAdmission
2. Reviewing the Konflux documentation for the most up-to-date information on resource interactions

Would you like me to help you find more detailed information about how RPAs reference RPs in Konflux?
