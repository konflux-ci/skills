Based on the skill's detailed explanation, I can answer your specific question about how the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP):

Key points about RP and RPA references:
1. They are **NOT** in the same namespace
2. ReleasePlan (RP) is created in the **tenant namespace** (your workspace)
3. ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created in the **managed namespace** (platform team controlled)
4. The RPA explicitly references the RP across namespace boundaries

Specifically:
- The RPA contains a reference to the ReleasePlan from the tenant namespace
- This allows the platform team to define release credentials and pipeline details
- The cross-namespace reference enables separation of concerns while maintaining the connection between the release plan and its admission/execution details

An example workflow would look like:
1. You (in tenant namespace) create a ReleasePlan pointing to your Application
2. Platform Engineer creates a ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace
3. The RPA includes a reference to your original ReleasePlan
4. This allows the release pipeline to be configured with the necessary credentials while still respecting your original release plan

The key takeaway is that they intentionally work across different namespaces, with the RPA explicitly referencing the RP to enable secure, controlled release processes.
