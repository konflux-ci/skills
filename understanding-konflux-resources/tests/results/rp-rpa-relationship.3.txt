Let me clarify the relationship between ReleasePlan (RP) and ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in Konflux:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP) through a cross-namespace reference. Specifically:

1. The RPA does NOT need to be in the same namespace as the ReleasePlan (RP).
2. The RPA references the ReleasePlan using a specific spec field that points to the ReleasePlan in another namespace.

Typically, the relationship works like this:
- The ReleasePlan (RP) is usually created in the application's source namespace
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created in a managed namespace
- The RPA spec includes a reference to the original ReleasePlan using its name and namespace

An example RPA spec might look like:
```yaml
spec:
  releasePlan:
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: source-namespace
```

This cross-namespace referencing allows for a flexible workflow where release plans can be managed across different namespaces while maintaining a clear link between the original release plan and its admission.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this relationship?
