Let me clarify the relationship between ReleasePlan (RP) and ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in Konflux based on my understanding:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP), but they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. 

The RPA is typically created in the managed namespace, while the original ReleasePlan (RP) is usually created in the tenant namespace. The RPA acts as an admission control mechanism that references the specific ReleasePlan it is associated with.

The key points are:
- RPA can reference an RP from a different namespace
- The RPA is typically created in the managed namespace
- The original RP is typically created in the tenant namespace
- The RPA uses a reference (likely through a name or UID) to link to the specific ReleasePlan

To get the most up-to-date and precise information, I recommend checking the current Konflux documentation or consulting with the Konflux development team for any recent changes in resource management.

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about how these resources interact?
