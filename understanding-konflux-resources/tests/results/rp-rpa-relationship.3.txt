Let me break down the relationship between ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) and ReleasePlan (RP) in Konflux:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP) through a specific field in its specification. The RPA must explicitly reference the ReleasePlan it is associated with. 

Regarding namespace placement:
- The RPA and RP do NOT need to be in the same namespace. 
- The RPA can reference an RP from a different namespace by specifying the full namespace and name of the ReleasePlan in its spec.

Typically, the RPA will have a spec that includes a reference to the ReleasePlan, something like:

```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlanAdmission
metadata:
  name: my-rpa
spec:
  releasePlan: 
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: different-namespace  # Can be a different namespace
```

This allows for flexibility in how ReleasePlans and their corresponding ReleasePlanAdmissions are organized across namespaces while maintaining a clear reference between the two resources.

The key points are:
1. RPAs reference RPs explicitly in their spec
2. They can be in different namespaces
3. The reference includes both the name and (optionally) the namespace of the ReleasePlan
