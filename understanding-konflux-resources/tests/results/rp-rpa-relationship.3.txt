To directly answer your questions:

1. **How does the RPA reference the RP?**
   - The ReleasePlanAdmission is typically configured to work with a specific ReleasePlan, though they are not in the same namespace.
   - The connection is usually made through matching labels, names, or Application references, ensuring the RPA knows which ReleasePlan it's supporting.

2. **Do they need to be in the same namespace?**
   - **No, they do NOT need to be in the same namespace.**
   - In fact, they SHOULD be in different namespaces:
     - ReleasePlan (RP) is in the TENANT namespace
     - ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is in the MANAGED namespace

This separation allows platform engineers to control release credentials and pipelines while giving developers the ability to initiate releases for their applications.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?
