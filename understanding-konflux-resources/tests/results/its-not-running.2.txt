Based on the diagnostic exploration, here are the key steps I recommend for troubleshooting why your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is not running:

1. **Verify ITS Configuration**
   - Run: `kubectl get integrationtestscenario -n <your-namespace>`
   - Check the details of your ITS resource
   - Ensure the `.spec.application` exactly matches your Application name
   - Confirm `.spec.components` list is complete and accurate

2. **Check Snapshot Creation**
   - Run: `kubectl get snapshots -n <your-namespace>`
   - Verify a Snapshot exists after your build completes
   - Confirm the Snapshot references the correct Component

3. **Inspect Build Status**
   - Run: `tkn pipelinerun list -n <your-namespace>`
   - Ensure your build PipelineRun completed successfully
   - Look for a 'Succeeded' status

4. **Examine ITS Events**
   - Run: `kubectl describe integrationtestscenario <its-name> -n <your-namespace>`
   - Look for any error messages or event logs explaining why the test isn't running

Common reasons for ITS not running include:
- Incorrect Application or Component references
- Snapshot not created or invalid
- Insufficient permissions
- Misconfigured Tekton pipeline

Would you like me to help you diagnose the specific issue by checking these details? If you can share the output of these commands (with sensitive information redacted), I can provide more targeted advice.
