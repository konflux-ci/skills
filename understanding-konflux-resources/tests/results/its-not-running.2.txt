Based on the exploration, here are some specific questions to help diagnose why your Integration Test Scenario is not running:

1. Can you confirm the following details:
   - The namespace where your Component, Application, and ITS are deployed
   - The names of your Component, Application, and IntegrationTestScenario resources
   - The output of `oc get integrationtestscenario -n <your-namespace>`
   - The output of `oc describe integrationtestscenario <its-name> -n <your-namespace>`

2. Have you verified that:
   - The Component is successfully built
   - A Snapshot was created after the build
   - The ITS is correctly linked to the Application or Component

To help you troubleshoot, I recommend running the following commands and sharing their output:
```bash
oc get application
oc get component
oc get integrationtestscenario
oc get snapshot
```

This will help me identify any missing configurations or connections that might be preventing your Integration Test Scenario from running after builds complete.

Is there any specific error message you've seen, or can you provide more details about your current setup?
