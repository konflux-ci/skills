Based on the comprehensive diagnostic analysis, I can see several potential reasons why your Integrated Test Suite (ITS) might not be running in Konflux. The most critical things to check are:

1. **IntegrationTestScenario Resource**: Ensure you have created an `IntegrationTestScenario` resource that explicitly defines your test configuration.

2. **Application-Component Binding**: Verify that your Component is properly bound to the Application.

3. **Snapshot Creation**: Confirm that a Snapshot is being created after your build completes.

To help diagnose this further, could you please run and share the following commands:

```bash
# Check IntegrationTestScenario
kubectl get integrationtestscenario -n <your-namespace>

# Check Component details
kubectl get component -n <your-namespace>

# Check recent PipelineRuns
kubectl get pipelinerun -n <your-namespace> --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -5

# Check Snapshots
kubectl get snapshot -n <your-namespace>
```

The output of these commands will help me precisely identify why your ITS is not running. Each of these commands checks a critical aspect of the Konflux pipeline that could be preventing your integration tests from executing.
