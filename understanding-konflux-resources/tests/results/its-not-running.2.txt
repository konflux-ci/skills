To help you further, I'll need more specific information:
1. Can you share the YAML configurations for your:
   - Component
   - Application
   - ReleasePlan (if you have one)
   - IntegrationTestScenario

2. When you say the ITS is not running, can you be more specific?
   - Are there any error messages?
   - Does the ITS show as pending, failed, or not triggered at all?
   - Have you checked the Konflux UI or run `oc get` commands to verify the resources?

Would you be able to provide those additional details so I can help you diagnose the specific issue preventing your IntegrationTestScenario from running?
