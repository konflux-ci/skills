Based on the exploration, here are some specific things to check:

1. Snapshot Verification:
   - Confirm that a Snapshot has been created after your Component build
   - The Snapshot should reference your Component and be in the same namespace as your Application

2. ITS Configuration Checklist:
   - Does your ITS spec correctly specify:
     * The Application reference
     * The Component reference
     * Test execution parameters
     * Container image to use for testing

3. Potential Debugging Steps:
   - Check the status of your Snapshot
   - Look for any error events or conditions in the Konflux resources
   - Verify namespace and RBAC permissions

Could you provide more details about:
- The YAML for your IntegrationTestScenario
- The namespace where your resources are deployed
- Any error messages you've seen in logs or resource status

This will help me provide more specific guidance on why your ITS is not running after builds complete.
