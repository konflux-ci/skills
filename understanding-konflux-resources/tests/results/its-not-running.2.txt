To help you diagnose this, I have a few questions:

1. Can you confirm which namespace your IntegrationTestScenario is created in?
2. Does your IntegrationTestScenario reference your Application or Component?
3. Have you verified that Snapshots are being created after your builds complete?

Each of these points is critical for ensuring that your Integration Test Scenario runs automatically after builds. 

A typical setup looks like:
- Application "my-app" in tenant namespace
- Component "my-component" in tenant namespace (points to git repo)
- IntegrationTestScenario in tenant namespace (references "my-app" or "my-component")
- Snapshots auto-created after successful builds
- Konflux automatically runs the ITS against the new Snapshot

Would you like to walk through checking these configuration points?
