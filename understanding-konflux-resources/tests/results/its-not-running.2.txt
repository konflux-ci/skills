To help diagnose why your ITS is not running, I'll need to ask a few clarifying questions:

1. Have you created an IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) resource specifically?
2. Is your Component successfully building?
3. Have you defined a ReleasePlan or ReleasePlanAdmission that should trigger the ITS?

Common reasons why an ITS might not run include:
- Missing ReleasePlan or ReleasePlanAdmission
- Incorrect configuration in the ITS resource
- Build not completing successfully
- Insufficient permissions or namespace configuration

Let me help you verify these potential issues. Could you provide:
- The YAML for your Component
- The YAML for your IntegrationTestScenario
- Any error messages you've seen in the Konflux UI or logs

This will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS is not triggering after builds complete.
