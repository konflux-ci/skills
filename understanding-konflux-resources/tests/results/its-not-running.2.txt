To help diagnose your specific issue, I'll need some more information:

1. Can you share the namespace where your Application, Component, and IntegrationTestScenario are created?
2. Do you have the YAML configuration for your IntegrationTestScenario?
3. Have you checked if a Snapshot was created after your build?

Key things to check immediately:
- Confirm all resources (App, Component, ITS) are in the SAME namespace
- Verify the ITS was created BEFORE or DURING the build process
- Check that a Snapshot was successfully created

I recommend running these commands in your cluster:
```bash
# Check IntegrationTestScenarios
kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-tenant-namespace>

# Check Snapshots
kubectl get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>

# Describe your ITS to see any potential configuration issues
kubectl describe integrationtestscenario <its-name> -n <your-tenant-namespace>
```

Could you provide the output of these commands or share more details about your setup?
