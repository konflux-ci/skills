Based on my knowledge of Konflux, there are several common reasons why an IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) might not run after builds complete:

1. **Missing ReleasePlan (RP)**: 
   - An IntegrationTestScenario typically requires a ReleasePlan to be created and associated with your Application and Component.
   - The ReleasePlan defines how and when tests should be run.

2. **Incomplete Component Configuration**:
   - Ensure your Component has all necessary build and source configurations.
   - Verify that the Component is correctly linked to the source repository.

3. **Snapshot Not Created**:
   - A Snapshot must be created after the build completes.
   - Check if your build process is generating the required Snapshot.

4. **Permission/RBAC Issues**:
   - Verify that the service account has sufficient permissions to create and run IntegrationTestScenarios.

5. **ITS Configuration**:
   - Review your IntegrationTestScenario manifest:
     - Ensure it's correctly referencing the Component
     - Check that the test specification is valid
     - Confirm the test container/image is accessible

Recommended troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify you have a ReleasePlan created for your Application
2. Check the Snapshot creation after build
3. Inspect the ITS and Component manifests
4. Review the Konflux CI/CD pipeline logs for any error messages

Would you like me to help you check these specific aspects? Could you share:
- The output of `oc get its` (IntegrationTestScenarios)
- The output of `oc get rp` (ReleasePlans)
- The output of `oc get snapshots`

This will help me diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario is not running.
