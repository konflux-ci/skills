I apologize for the tool limitations. Based on my knowledge of Konflux resources, there are a few key things to check when an IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is not running after builds:

1. **Snapshot Requirement**: 
   - Ensure that a Snapshot has been created for your Component after the build completes.
   - The ITS typically requires a valid Snapshot to trigger tests.

2. **ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission**:
   - Check if you have a ReleasePlan that includes your Component.
   - Verify that the ReleasePlanAdmission is approved and matches your Component.

3. **ITS Configuration**:
   - Confirm that your IntegrationTestScenario:
     - Correctly references the Application and Component
     - Has the right test specifications
     - Is in the same namespace as your other resources

4. **Build Status**:
   - Verify that the build completed successfully
   - Check if the Snapshot was created correctly after the build

Recommended troubleshooting steps:
1. Run `oc get snapshots` to list existing snapshots
2. Check `oc get its` to see the status of your IntegrationTestScenario
3. Examine the events and conditions of your ITS resource using `oc describe its <its-name>`
4. Verify the Snapshot references in your ITS matches the latest build

Would you like me to help you walk through checking these specific points? Could you share:
- The output of `oc get snapshots`
- The output of `oc get its`
- The full YAML of your IntegrationTestScenario

This will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS is not running after builds complete.
