Based on the diagnostic results, I can see that there are multiple potential reasons why your Integrated Test Suite (ITS) might not be running after builds complete in Konflux. 

The agent has outlined several key areas to investigate:

1. **IntegrationTestScenario Configuration**
   - Ensure you have created an IntegrationTestScenario Custom Resource (CR)
   - Verify it's correctly linked to your Application

2. **Test Pipeline Definition**
   - Check that your test pipeline is valid
   - Confirm it has the required parameters (like SNAPSHOT)

3. **Component-Application Binding**
   - Verify the Component is correctly referenced in the Application

4. **Snapshot Creation**
   - Confirm that Snapshots are being created after builds

To move forward, I need you to provide some additional information:

1. Can you confirm you have an IntegrationTestScenario created?
2. What is the namespace where your Konflux resources are deployed?
3. Can you share the output of the following commands:
   ```bash
   kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-namespace>
   kubectl get applications -n <your-namespace>
   kubectl get components -n <your-namespace>
   kubectl get snapshots -n <your-namespace> --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -5
   ```

With this information, I can help you diagnose exactly why your ITS is not running and provide specific steps to resolve the issue.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these potential causes or help you investigate further?
