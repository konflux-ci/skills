Based on the comprehensive analysis, the most likely reason your Issue Tracking System (ITS) is not running after builds complete is the absence of an `IntegrationTestScenario` resource. 

Key points:
1. Having a Component and Application is not enough
2. You need to explicitly define an `IntegrationTestScenario`
3. This resource tells Konflux how and when to run integration tests

To proceed, I recommend you:
1. Confirm the existence of an IntegrationTestScenario:
```bash
kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-namespace>
```

If this returns no results, you'll need to create an IntegrationTestScenario. I can help you draft one, but I'll need a bit more information:
- What is your application name?
- Do you have a specific test pipeline defined in your repository?
- What is the URL of your repository?

Could you provide those details so I can help you create the correct IntegrationTestScenario configuration?
