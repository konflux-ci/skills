I apologize for the WebSearch error. Let me provide guidance based on standard Konflux practices:

Typical IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) configuration should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: my-test-scenario
spec:
  application: my-application-name
  componentName: my-component-name
  # Additional test scenario specifics
```

Key things to check:
1. Ensure the `spec.application` exactly matches your Application's name
2. Verify `spec.componentName` precisely matches your Component's name
3. Confirm the ITS is in the same namespace as your Application and Component

Suggestions for troubleshooting:
1. Verify your Component and Application names
2. Check the ITS resource's namespace
3. Look for any error events related to the ITS in your cluster

Would you like me to help you:
- Review your current IntegrationTestScenario configuration?
- Check the specific names of your Application and Component?
- Investigate potential namespace or permission issues?
