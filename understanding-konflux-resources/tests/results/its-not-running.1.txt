I apologize for the error. Let me break down the typical requirements for an IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) in Konflux:

1. **Component and Application**: You mentioned you have these set up, which is good.

2. **ITS Resource Configuration**: Your IntegrationTestScenario should include:
   - A reference to the specific Component
   - The Application name
   - Test specification (what tests to run)
   - Appropriate labels and selectors

Example ITS resource might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: my-integration-test
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: my-application
spec:
  application: my-application
  component: my-component
  testSpec:
    # Test configuration details
```

Potential reasons why your ITS might not be running:
1. Missing or incorrect labels
2. The build snapshot might not be correctly linked
3. Permissions or RBAC issues
4. Misconfigured test specifications

To troubleshoot, I recommend:
1. Verify the ITS resource exists and is correctly configured
2. Check the build snapshot references
3. Look at the ITS and build pipeline status in the Konflux console or using `oc get` commands

Would you like me to help you:
- Review your current ITS configuration
- Check for common misconfiguration issues
- Provide a template for a working IntegrationTestScenario

What specific details can you share about your current setup?
