Based on the exploration, I recommend you check the following:

1. Namespace Verification
   - Confirm your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is in the SAME tenant namespace as your Application and Component
   
2. Resource Configuration
   - Ensure your ITS explicitly references the correct Application name
   - Verify you have a Tekton pipeline configured that the ITS can reference

3. Snapshot Check
   - Run `kubectl get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>` to confirm Snapshots are being created after builds

Could you provide me with:
1. The namespace you're using
2. The name of your Application
3. The name of your IntegrationTestScenario
4. Output of `kubectl get snapshots -n <namespace>`

This will help me precisely diagnose why your ITS is not running after builds complete.

Would you like to share those details so I can help you troubleshoot?
