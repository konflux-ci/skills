To help you further, could you confirm:
1. Can you share the `kubectl get its -n <your-tenant-namespace>` output?
2. What Application does your ITS reference?
3. Did your builds complete successfully?

The key things to check are:
- IntegrationTestScenario must exist in the TENANT namespace
- It must reference your Application 
- Snapshots must be created after builds (Konflux does this automatically)

Would you like me to help you verify these steps?
