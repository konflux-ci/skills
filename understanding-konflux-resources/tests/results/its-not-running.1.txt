I'll help you diagnose potential issues with your Integration Test Scenario (ITS). There are several key things to check:

1. ReleasePlan Configuration
An ITS typically requires a properly configured ReleasePlan to trigger tests after builds. Let me ask some specific questions:

- Have you created a ReleasePlan for your Application?
- Does the ReleasePlan explicitly reference your Component and specify how IntegrationTestScenarios should be run?

2. Common Reasons ITS Might Not Run
- The ReleasePlan might not be matching your Component
- Missing ReleasePlanAdmission
- Incorrect namespace configuration
- The ITS itself might have validation or configuration issues

To help diagnose, could you provide me with the following information:
- The namespace where your Application and Component are deployed
- The content of your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) resource
- The content of your ReleasePlan resource

Specific things I'll help you check:
- Verify the ITS is in the same namespace as your Component
- Ensure the ReleasePlan correctly references your Component
- Check that the ITS has all required configurations (like build pipeline references)

Would you be willing to share those resource configurations so I can help you pinpoint exactly why the ITS is not running?
