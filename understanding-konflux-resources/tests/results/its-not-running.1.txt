To help diagnose the issue, could you provide me with the following information:
1. The YAML for your IntegrationTestScenario resource
2. The namespace where the ITS is created
3. Confirm that you have both an Application and Component set up
4. Share the output of `kubectl get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>`

This will help me identify why your ITS is not running after builds complete.

Would you like me to walk you through creating or troubleshooting an IntegrationTestScenario?
