I recommend you verify the following:

1. Namespace Check:
   - Run `kubectl get its -n <your-tenant-namespace>`
   - Confirm your IntegrationTestScenario exists in the TENANT namespace

2. Application and Component Relationship:
   - Ensure your ITS references the exact Application name
   - Verify the Component is part of that Application

3. Tekton Pipeline:
   - Check that the Tekton pipeline referenced in your ITS exists
   - Confirm the pipeline is valid and can be executed

Could you share:
- The namespace you're using
- Your IntegrationTestScenario YAML
- The Application and Component names

This will help me diagnose why the ITS is not running after builds complete. Snapshots are auto-created by the Integration Service, so if your builds are completing successfully, the next step should be running your defined tests.
