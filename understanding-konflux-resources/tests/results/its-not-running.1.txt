I apologize for the WebSearch error. Let me provide some specific troubleshooting steps:

To diagnose why your ITS is not running:

1. Verify ReleasePlan Existence:
   ```bash
   kubectl get releaseplans -n <your-namespace>
   ```
   Ensure there's a ReleasePlan that references your Component and Application.

2. Check IntegrationTestScenario Status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-namespace>
   kubectl describe integrationtestscenario <its-name>
   ```
   Look for any error messages or status conditions that might explain why the test is not running.

3. Check ReleasePlanAdmission:
   ```bash
   kubectl get releaseplanadmissions -n <your-namespace>
   ```
   Confirm that a ReleasePlanAdmission exists and is in a valid state.

Common Checklist:
- [ ] ReleasePlan created
- [ ] ReleasePlanAdmission exists
- [ ] IntegrationTestScenario configured correctly
- [ ] Component and Application are in the same namespace
- [ ] Necessary permissions are set up

Would you like me to help you walk through checking these specific resources? Could you provide:
1. The namespace you're working in
2. The names of your Component and Application
3. The name of your IntegrationTestScenario

This will help me provide more targeted assistance in diagnosing why your ITS is not running after builds complete.
