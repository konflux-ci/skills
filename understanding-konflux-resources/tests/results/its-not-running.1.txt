Based on the comprehensive troubleshooting analysis, here are the key things to check for why your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is not running:

1. **ITS Configuration**
   - Verify the ITS exists: `oc get integrationtestscenarios`
   - Confirm it references the correct Application name
   - Check that the ITS spec correctly matches your Component and Application

2. **Snapshot Verification**
   - Ensure a Snapshot was created after your build: `oc get snapshots`
   - Check if the Snapshot has the correct labels
   - Verify the Snapshot is linked to your Application and Component

3. **Pipeline and Permissions**
   - Confirm the referenced Tekton pipeline exists: `oc get pipelines`
   - Check for any RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) issues
   - Review cluster events for any blocking conditions: `oc get events`

Common reasons an ITS might not run:
- ❌ Incorrect Application or Component reference
- ❌ No Snapshot created
- ❌ Missing pipeline configuration
- ❌ Namespace or permission problems

To diagnose further, I recommend:
1. Run `oc describe integrationtestscenario <its-name>` to get detailed information
2. Check `oc get events` to see if there are any error messages
3. Verify your Snapshot creation with `oc get snapshots`

Would you like me to help you walk through checking these specific points? Could you share the output of `oc get integrationtestscenarios` and `oc get snapshots` so I can provide more targeted advice?
