I'll help you diagnose the specific issue. Could you provide me with more details:

1. Can you share the YAML for your IntegrationTestScenario?
2. What namespace are your Application, Component, and IntegrationTestScenario in?
3. Have you confirmed that Snapshots are being created after your builds?

I recommend running these commands to get more information:
```bash
kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-tenant-namespace>
kubectl get snapshots -n <your-tenant-namespace>
kubectl describe integrationtestscenario <its-name> -n <your-tenant-namespace>
```

These will help us pinpoint exactly why your IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering after builds.
