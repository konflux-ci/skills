To help you troubleshoot, I'll need some additional information:

1. Can you share the namespace where your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is configured?
2. Could you provide the output of `oc get its -n <your-namespace>`?
3. Can you share the output of `oc describe its <its-name> -n <your-namespace>`?
4. What are the labels on your snapshot and build?

These details will help me diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering after builds. The most common reasons include:
- Incorrect label matching
- Misconfigured ITS specification
- Permission issues
- Snapshot creation problems

Please provide the requested information, and I'll help you identify and resolve the issue.
