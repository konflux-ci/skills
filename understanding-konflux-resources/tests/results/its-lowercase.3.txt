To help you more effectively, I'll need more information:
1. Can you share the output of the following commands:
   - `oc get its` (to list IntegrationTestScenarios)
   - `oc get snapshots` (to check recent snapshots)
   - `oc describe its [your-its-name]` (to get detailed ITS configuration)

2. Confirm:
   - Are the builds completing successfully?
   - Is the snapshot being created after the build?
   - Do you see any error messages or warnings in the ITS or snapshot resources?

Could you provide those details so I can help you diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering?
