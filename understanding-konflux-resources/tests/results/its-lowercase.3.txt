I apologize, but I need more specific information to diagnose why your Konflux pipeline isn't triggering after builds. The pipeline trigger could be failing due to various reasons such as:

1. Misconfigured trigger settings
2. Permission issues
3. EventListener problems
4. Build status not meeting trigger conditions
5. Networking or webhook configuration errors

Could you please provide:
- The project repository URL
- The specific build system you're using (GitHub Actions, OpenShift Pipelines, etc.)
- Any error messages you've seen
- The contents of your `.tekton/` directory (if possible)
- Recent build logs or pipeline run statuses

The more details you can share, the more accurately I can help you troubleshoot the issue. If you're comfortable, you can run the following commands and share the output:

```bash
# Check Tekton pipeline configurations
ls -la .tekton/

# Check recent PipelineRuns (if using OpenShift/Kubernetes)
oc get pipelineruns

# Check build logs
# (Command depends on your specific build system)
```
