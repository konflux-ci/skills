To help diagnose the specific problem, I'll need some additional information from you:

1. Can you provide the namespace where your IntegrationTestScenario is defined?
2. Could you share the output of `oc describe integrationtestscenario <its-name>` for the specific ITS?
3. Can you confirm the status of your recent build and associated Snapshot?

These details will help me pinpoint exactly why your Integration Test Scenario isn't triggering after builds. Some common issues include:
- Misconfigured references
- Build not creating a valid Snapshot
- Permissions problems
- Matching conditions not being met

Please provide those details, and I'll help you troubleshoot the specific reason your ITS isn't running.
