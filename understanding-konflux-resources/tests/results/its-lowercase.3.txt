To help me assist you more effectively, could you provide more details:
1. What is the name of your IntegrationTestScenario?
2. In which namespace is it located?
3. Can you share the output of `kubectl get its -n <namespace>` and `kubectl describe its <its-name>`?
4. Do you see any specific error messages or events related to the ITS?

The more information you can provide, the better I can help you diagnose why the IntegrationTestScenario isn't triggering after builds. I'll guide you through a systematic troubleshooting process to identify and resolve the issue.
