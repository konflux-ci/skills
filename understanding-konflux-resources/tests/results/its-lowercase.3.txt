Based on the comprehensive diagnostic report, it seems we need more specific information to pinpoint the exact reason why your Konflux pipeline isn't triggering after builds. 

I've prepared a systematic approach to help you troubleshoot:

1. Could you provide the following information:
   - The namespace you're using in Konflux
   - The output of `kubectl get builds -n <your-namespace>`
   - The output of `kubectl get pipelineruns -n <your-namespace>`
   - Contents of your `.tekton/` directory

2. Can you confirm:
   - Are the builds completing successfully?
   - Have you recently changed any pipeline configuration?
   - Are there any error messages in the Konflux dashboard or logs?

The diagnostic report I generated covers the most common reasons why pipelines might not trigger, including:
- Misconfigured pipeline triggers
- Webhook integration issues
- RBAC/Permission problems
- EventListener configuration
- Build annotation problems
- Namespace resource constraints

Without more specific details, I can't definitively say what's causing your issue. The more information you can provide, the more precisely I can help you resolve the pipeline triggering problem.

Would you like to share the additional details I requested?
