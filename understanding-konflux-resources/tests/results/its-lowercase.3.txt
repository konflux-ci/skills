Based on the investigation, I recommend taking the following steps:

1. Verify Snapshot Creation
   - Run `oc get snapshots` to list recent snapshots
   - Check the status of the most recent snapshot
   - Confirm it's associated with your Component and Application

2. Inspect IntegrationTestScenario
   - Use `oc describe integrationtestscenario [your-its-name]` to get detailed information
   - Look for any conditions or events that might explain why it's not triggering

3. Check Build Status
   - Verify your Component build completed successfully
   - Examine build logs for any potential issues

Could you provide me with:
- The name of your IntegrationTestScenario
- The name of your Application and Component
- Any error messages or logs you've seen

This will help me provide more specific guidance on why your ITS isn't triggering after builds.

Would you like me to help you investigate further or walk you through troubleshooting the ITS trigger?
