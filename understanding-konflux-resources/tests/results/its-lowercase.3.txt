Let me help you investigate your specific situation. Could you provide more details:

1. Can you share the contents of your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) resource?
2. What namespace is your ITS defined in?
3. Have you successfully built your Component?
4. Have you checked the events or conditions of your ITS?

A few quick commands you can run to help diagnose:
```bash
# List your IntegrationTestScenarios
oc get integrationtestscenarios

# Describe the ITS to see its current state
oc describe integrationtestscenario <its-name>

# Check recent events
oc get events
```

The most common reasons an ITS doesn't trigger are:
- Incorrect labels
- Mismatched namespace
- Build not completing successfully
- Snapshot not created
- Tekton pipeline issues

I'll be happy to help you pinpoint and resolve the specific issue preventing your ITS from running.
