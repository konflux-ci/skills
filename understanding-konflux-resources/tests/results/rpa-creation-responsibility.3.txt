Let me help you understand ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) creation based on the Konflux resources reference.

According to the "Understanding Konflux Resources" skill, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is specifically created by a **Platform Engineer**, not by a regular application developer. 

Here's the key information from the reference:

| Resource | Who Creates | Namespace | Key Point |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| ReleasePlanAdmission | Platform Engineer | **Managed** | Contains release pipeline credentials |

So to directly answer your question: No, you (as a typical application developer) do not create the RPA. The Platform Engineer is responsible for creating the ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace. 

Your role is to:
1. Create a ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace
2. Reference the ReleasePlan in your Release CR when you want to release a snapshot

The Platform Engineer will create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace, which contains the necessary credentials and defines the release pipeline details.

This separation ensures that:
- Developers can request releases
- Sensitive credentials remain isolated
- Release pipelines are centrally managed by platform engineers
