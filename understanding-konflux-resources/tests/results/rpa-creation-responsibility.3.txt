No, you do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) directly. In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission is typically created automatically by the system based on the ReleasePlan and the current state of your Application and Components.

Here's a brief overview:
- The ReleasePlan is usually created by you or your team
- The ReleasePlanAdmission is then automatically generated by the Konflux system
- It represents the admission of a specific release to a specific environment
- The system manages the RPA based on the conditions specified in the ReleasePlan

The RPA is a way for Konflux to manage and track the approval and progression of releases through different stages of your software delivery pipeline. You don't manually create it - instead, it's a resource that Konflux generates and manages automatically as part of the release process.

If you want to understand more about how ReleasePlanAdmissions work in your specific Konflux setup, I recommend checking your project's configuration or consulting with your team's DevOps engineer who can provide more context specific to your implementation.
