Based on my knowledge of Konflux, you typically do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself. The RPA is usually automatically created by the Konflux system based on the existing ReleasePlan (RP) and the current state of your application and components.

Here's a breakdown:
- The ReleasePlan (RP) is created by you or your team
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is automatically generated by the Konflux CI/CD system
- The RPA represents the admission of a specific release plan, checking if the components meet the necessary criteria for release

The RPA is a system-generated resource that:
- Validates if the components in the ReleasePlan are ready for release
- Checks if all required tests and checks have passed
- Determines whether the release can proceed

So to directly answer your question: No, you do not create the RPA manually. It is automatically created and managed by the Konflux system in response to your ReleasePlan.

Would you like me to elaborate on how ReleasePlans and ReleasePlanAdmissions work in Konflux?
