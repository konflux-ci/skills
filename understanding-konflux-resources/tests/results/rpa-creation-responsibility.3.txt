Based on the skill information, I can directly answer your question:

No, **YOU** do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created by the **Platform Engineer** in the **managed namespace**. This is a critical distinction in Konflux:

- You create the **ReleasePlan (RP)** in your tenant namespace
- The Platform Engineer creates the **ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)** in the managed namespace

The RPA contains release pipeline credentials and is manually created by the platform team. It's not automatically generated, and it's not something you (as a developer or application owner) create.

Your role is to:
1. Create the Application
2. Create Components
3. Create the ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace

The Platform Engineer will then create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in the managed namespace to complete the release pipeline setup.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?
