I apologize for the persistent error. Since I cannot use WebSearch at the moment, I'll provide guidance based on my existing knowledge about Konflux:

In Konflux, you typically do not directly create the RPA yourself. The Reusable Pipeline Artifact is usually generated automatically by the Konflux platform based on your pipeline configuration. 

The RPA is created as part of the build and deployment process, specifically:
1. When you define your pipeline configuration
2. During the build process of your application
3. As part of the continuous integration workflow

To get a definitive answer about RPA creation in your specific Konflux setup, I recommend:
- Checking the Konflux documentation
- Consulting with your team's DevOps or platform engineering team
- Reviewing your specific Konflux configuration

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about RPAs in your Konflux environment?
