No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself in Konflux. The ReleasePlanAdmission is usually created automatically by the system based on the ReleasePlan. 

Here's a brief explanation:
- The ReleasePlan is created by the user or application owner
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is then automatically generated by the Konflux system
- The RPA represents the system's approval or admission of the release plan

The RPA is a system-managed resource that validates and tracks the admission of a specific release plan. It's part of the automated release process in Konflux, ensuring that releases meet the necessary criteria and go through proper approval workflows.

If you need more specific details about how RPAs work in your particular Konflux setup, I recommend consulting your team's specific implementation or Konflux documentation.

Would you like me to help you understand more about how ReleasePlans and ReleasePlanAdmissions work in Konflux?
