No, you typically do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) yourself. In Konflux, the RPA is automatically created by the system as part of the release process. 

Here's a brief breakdown:
- Release Plan (RP) is usually created by a user or application developer
- The system then automatically generates the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA)
- The RPA represents the system's decision and approval for the release plan

The RPA is an automated resource that reflects whether the specific release plan meets the necessary criteria and can be admitted (approved) for progression in the release pipeline. It's essentially a system-generated confirmation of the release plan's readiness.

If you want to understand more about the specific criteria or process for RPA creation, I recommend consulting the Konflux documentation or speaking with your team's release engineering experts.
