Let me clarify about ReleasePlanAdmissions (RPA) in Konflux:

In Konflux, you typically do NOT create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) directly. The RPA is automatically created by the Konflux system as part of the release management process. 

Here's a breakdown:
- The ReleaseПлан (RP) is created by the application team
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is then automatically generated by the Konflux system
- The RPA represents the system's admission or validation of the release plan
- It's a way for Konflux to manage and control the release process

The RPA is essentially a system-managed resource that confirms whether a particular release plan meets the necessary criteria and can proceed. You don't manually create it, but rather it's a result of your ReleasePlan and the system's evaluation of that plan.

If you want to understand the specifics of how an RPA is generated or what criteria it checks, I recommend consulting the Konflux documentation or speaking with your team's platform engineering support.
