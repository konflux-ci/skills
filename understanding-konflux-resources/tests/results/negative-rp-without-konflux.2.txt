Based on the detailed explanation from the Konflux resources skill, I can provide a clear answer about creating your ReleasePlan (RP).

You should create the ReleasePlan (RP) in your **tenant namespace**. Here are the key points:

1. ReleasePlan (RP) goes in the tenant namespace (your workspace)
2. It maps an Application to a release action
3. It is created by you (the application owner)

The process typically looks like this:
- First, create an Application (to group your Components)
- Then, create Components (pointing to your git repositories)
- When ready to set up releases, create a ReleasePlan in your tenant namespace

An example might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlan
metadata:
  name: my-application-release-plan
  namespace: <your-tenant-namespace>
spec:
  application: my-application-name
  # Other release plan specifications
```

Important reminders:
- DO NOT create the ReleasePlan in the managed namespace
- The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) will be created separately by the Platform Engineer in the managed namespace
- The RP and RPA work together across different namespaces

Would you like me to help you create a ReleasePlan for your specific project?
