I noticed that we're currently in the `/tmp` directory, which doesn't seem to be the actual project directory. To accurately help you create a ReleasePlan, I'll need more information:

1. Can you confirm the correct project directory?
2. Do you have an existing Application resource in Konflux?
3. Do you know the specific namespace where your Konflux Application is deployed?

Generally, in Konflux, you would create a ReleasePlan (RP) in the same namespace as your Application. The typical steps are:
1. Identify the namespace of your Konflux Application
2. Create the ReleasePlan in that same namespace
3. Ensure the ReleasePlan references the correct Application resource

Could you provide more details about your project's Konflux setup so I can give you more precise guidance?
