I apologize for the error. Let me provide guidance based on standard Konflux practices:

In Konflux, ReleasePlans (RPs) are typically created in the **tenant namespace**. This is the namespace associated with your specific project or team. 

Key points about ReleasePlan placement:
- Created in the tenant namespace
- Managed by the application team
- Associated with a specific Application resource
- Used to define how and when components should be released

To create your ReleasePlan, you'll want to:
1. Ensure you're in the correct tenant namespace
2. Create the ReleasePlan that references your Application and its Components
3. Define the release strategy, including any specific requirements for building, testing, and deploying

Would you like me to help you draft the ReleasePlan configuration for your specific project? If you can provide more context about your application and its components, I can give more precise guidance.

Is there anything specific about the ReleasePlan you're looking to create that you'd like me to clarify?
