Based on the detailed investigation, here's a concise answer to your question:

You should create your ReleasePlan (RP) in your **Tenant Namespace**. This is the namespace where your Application and Components are located. The ReleasePlan is created by you (the application owner/developer) and defines how your application should be released.

Would you like me to help you draft the specific ReleasePlan configuration for your project?
