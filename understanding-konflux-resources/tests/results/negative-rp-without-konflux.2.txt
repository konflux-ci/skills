Let me explain based on standard Konflux practices:

In Konflux, Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the tenant namespace. This means:
- The Release Plan should be created in the namespace associated with your specific project or team
- It's usually created after you have:
  1. Defined an Application
  2. Created Components
  3. Generated Snapshots

The typical workflow is:
1. Create your Application in the tenant namespace
2. Define Components for your Application
3. Generate Snapshots of those Components
4. Create a Release Plan in the same tenant namespace

If you're unsure about the exact namespace, I recommend:
- Checking with your team's Konflux administrator
- Verifying the current namespace using `oc project` or `kubectl config current-context`

Would you like me to help you locate or create the Release Plan in the correct namespace?
