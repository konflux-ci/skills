I noticed that we're currently not in a git repository, which means we might need more context about the specific project you're working on. 

Could you provide more details about:
1. The project you're working on
2. The specific Konflux environment or namespace you're using
3. Whether this is a new project or an existing one

Typically, Release Plans (RPs) in Konflux are created in a specific namespace associated with your application. The general steps involve:
- Identifying the correct namespace for your application
- Creating the ReleasePlan (RP) custom resource in that namespace
- Ensuring it's linked to the correct Application and Component resources

Would you like me to help you create the Release Plan? If so, I'll need more information about your specific setup.
