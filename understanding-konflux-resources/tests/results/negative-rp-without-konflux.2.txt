I apologize for the tool limitations. Based on my understanding of Konflux CI, Release Plans (RPs) are typically created in the same namespace as your Application and Components. 

To determine the exact namespace:
1. Confirm the namespace of your existing Konflux Application and Components
2. Create the Release Plan (RP) in that same namespace

The key things to remember about Release Plans in Konflux are:
- They are namespace-specific
- They should be created in the same namespace as the related Application
- They define the release strategy for your application's components

Would you like me to help you verify the current namespace of your project? If you can provide more details about your existing Konflux resources, I can give more specific guidance on where to create your Release Plan.
