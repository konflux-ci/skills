Let me clarify the relationship between Release Plan Admission (RPA) and Release Plan (RP) in Konflux based on my knowledge:

In Konflux, the Release Plan Admission (RPA) references the Release Plan (RP), but they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. The RPA is typically created to validate and approve a specific Release Plan.

Key points:
1. The RPA contains a reference to the Release Plan it is evaluating
2. This reference is typically done through a cross-namespace reference
3. The RPA can exist in a different namespace from the original Release Plan
4. The reference is usually made using the name and namespace of the original Release Plan

For example, an RPA might look something like this conceptually:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlanAdmission
metadata:
  name: my-rpa
spec:
  releaseplan:
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: different-namespace
```

This design allows for flexible governance across different namespaces, enabling central teams to review and approve release plans from various project namespaces.

If you'd like more specific details about the exact implementation or want to verify the current behavior, I recommend checking the current Konflux documentation or the source code for the most up-to-date information.
