I apologize for the search limitation. Based on my understanding of Kubernetes-native release management systems, I can provide some general insights, but I recommend confirming the specifics with Konflux's official documentation:

Typically, in Kubernetes-based systems:
1. Release Plan (RP) and Release Plan Admission (RPA) are often custom resources that can have specific namespace relationships.

Possible scenarios:
- They might need to be in the same namespace
- The RPA might reference the RP across different namespaces
- The RPA could be a validation mechanism for the RP

However, without access to Konflux-specific documentation, I cannot definitively state their exact relationship. 

Recommendations for getting a precise answer:
1. Check Konflux's official documentation
2. Examine the Konflux GitHub repository
3. Look at the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that define these resources
4. Consult Konflux support channels or community forums

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about their namespace relationship through alternative means?
