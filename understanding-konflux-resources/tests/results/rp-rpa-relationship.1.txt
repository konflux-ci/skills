To directly answer your questions:

1. **How does the RPA reference the RP?**
   The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) explicitly references the ReleasePlan (RP) by its name, but crucially, this reference is made across different namespaces. The RPA will have a configuration that points to the specific ReleasePlan in the tenant namespace.

2. **Do they need to be in the same namespace?**
   **No, they absolutely should NOT be in the same namespace.** 
   - The ReleasePlan (RP) must be in the TENANT namespace
   - The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) must be in the MANAGED namespace

This separation is intentional for security reasons, allowing application owners to define release strategies while platform engineers manage the actual release credentials and pipeline configurations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or provide more details about how these resources interact?
