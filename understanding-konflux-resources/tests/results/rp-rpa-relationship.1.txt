I apologize for the inconclusive response. Given the limitations in searching, I recommend:

1. Checking the official Konflux documentation for the most accurate information about RPA and RP namespace requirements.
2. Consulting with your Konflux platform team or administrators who can provide the specific implementation details for your organization.

The key points from my previous response remain:
- RPAs are typically associated with specific namespaces
- They often need to be in a namespace with appropriate permissions
- The exact requirements can vary based on your specific Konflux configuration

Would you like me to help you find more specific documentation or clarify any aspects of this relationship?
