Let me explain based on my understanding of Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references a ReleasePlan (RP) through a specific reference mechanism. The RPA typically includes a reference to the ReleasePlan it is associated with. 

Regarding namespace placement:
- The RPA and RP do NOT need to be in the same namespace
- The RPA can reference a ReleasePlan from a different namespace

The reference is usually done through a specific field in the RPA's spec that points to the ReleasePlan. This allows for flexibility in how release plans and their admissions are organized across namespaces.

Key points:
1. RPAs can reference RPs across different namespaces
2. The reference is typically a cross-namespace reference using the ReleasePlan's name and namespace
3. This design allows for more modular and flexible release management in Konflux

If you'd like more specific details about the exact reference mechanism, I recommend checking the Konflux documentation or the specific custom resource definitions for the most up-to-date and precise information.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of how RPAs and RPs interact in Konflux?
