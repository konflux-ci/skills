Based on the skill information, I can directly answer your question about how the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP) in Konflux:

The ReleasePlan (RP) and ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) are intentionally placed in DIFFERENT namespaces:
- ReleasePlan (RP) is created in the TENANT namespace (your workspace)
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created in the MANAGED namespace (platform team's controlled namespace)

Importantly, the RPA explicitly references the ReleasePlan across these namespace boundaries. This design allows:
1. Developers to define release plans in their tenant namespace
2. Platform engineers to manage release credentials and pipelines in a separate managed namespace
3. A cross-namespace reference that maintains separation of concerns

Key points:
- They do NOT need to be in the same namespace
- The RPA is manually created by a Platform Engineer
- The RPA references the RP using its name and namespace
- This allows secure management of release credentials while giving developers control over release plans

So to directly answer your questions:
- The RPA references the RP by its name and namespace
- They are INTENTIONALLY in different namespaces as a security and access control mechanism
