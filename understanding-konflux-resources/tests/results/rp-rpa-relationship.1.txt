I apologize for the search limitation. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

In Konflux, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP), and they typically need to be in the same namespace. The RPA is created as an admission to a specific ReleasePlan, which means:

1. The RPA contains a reference to the ReleasePlan (RP)
2. This reference is usually done through a namespace-scoped reference
3. Best practice is to create both the RP and RPA in the same namespace

The reference is typically implemented through:
- A spec field in the RPA that points to the specific ReleasePlan
- Namespace-level coupling ensures clear association and prevents cross-namespace conflicts

If you need the most up-to-date or precise information, I recommend checking the current Konflux documentation or consulting with the Konflux team directly, as the exact implementation details can evolve.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation about how RPAs reference RPs in Konflux?
