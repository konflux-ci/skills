I apologize for the inconvenience. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references a ReleasePlan (RP), but they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. The RPA is typically created in a managed namespace and references the ReleasePlan, which is usually created in a tenant namespace.

The key points are:
1. The RPA is a resource that admits (approves) a specific ReleasePlan
2. The RPA can be in a different namespace from the ReleasePlan it references
3. This design allows for separation of concerns between tenant-level planning and managed namespace operations

The reference is typically done through a cross-namespace reference, where the RPA contains a reference to the specific ReleasePlan it is admitting, using the ReleasePlan's name and namespace.

If you'd like more precise details about the exact mechanism of this reference, I recommend checking the Konflux documentation or the specific custom resource definitions for ReleasePlans and ReleasePlanAdmissions.

Would you like me to help you find more specific information about how these resources interact?
