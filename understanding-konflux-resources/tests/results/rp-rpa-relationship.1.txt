I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

In Konflux, a ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) typically references a ReleasePlan (RP) through a specific reference in its spec. While they don't strictly need to be in the same namespace, the RPA usually includes a reference to the RP it's associated with.

The key points are:
1. The RPA has a spec that includes a reference to the ReleasePlan
2. This reference typically includes the name and namespace of the ReleasePlan
3. While they can be in different namespaces, the RPA must be able to locate and reference the RP correctly

The reference might look something like this in the RPA's spec:
```yaml
spec:
  releasePlan:
    name: my-release-plan
    namespace: my-namespace
```

This allows the RPA to:
- Locate the specific ReleasePlan it's meant to work with
- Potentially work across different namespaces if needed
- Maintain a clear, explicit link between the RPA and its corresponding RP

To get the most up-to-date and precise information, I recommend:
1. Checking the current Konflux documentation
2. Reviewing the specific Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission
3. Consulting with your Konflux cluster administrators about the exact implementation in your specific setup

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about how RPAs reference RPs in your Konflux environment?
