Based on the skill documentation, I can provide a detailed answer to your question about how the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP):

1. Namespace Relationship:
   - ReleasePlan (RP) is created in the **tenant namespace** (your workspace)
   - ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created in the **managed namespace** (platform team's controlled namespace)

2. Reference Mechanism:
   - The RPA references the RP **across different namespaces**
   - They do NOT need to be in the same namespace
   - In fact, they are **intentionally placed in different namespaces** as a security design

3. Key Points:
   - The Platform Engineer manually creates the RPA in the managed namespace
   - The RPA explicitly references the ReleasePlan from the tenant namespace
   - This cross-namespace reference allows the platform team to define release credentials and pipeline details while keeping the release plan itself in the application owner's namespace

Practical Example:
```
Tenant Namespace:
- ReleasePlan: "my-app-prod-release"
  - Points to your Application
  - Defines release strategy

Managed Namespace:
- ReleasePlanAdmission: "prod-admission"
  - References "my-app-prod-release" from tenant namespace
  - Contains production credentials
  - Defines specific release pipeline details
```

This design ensures:
- Application owners control their release plans
- Platform team manages release credentials and pipelines
- Clear separation of concerns between development and operations teams

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of how RPA references RP?
