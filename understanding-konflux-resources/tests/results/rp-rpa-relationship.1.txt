To directly answer your questions:

1. **How does the RPA reference the RP?**
   The ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is typically configured to match the ReleasePlan (RP) by referencing the same Application or following a naming/labeling convention established by your platform team.

2. **Do they need to be in the same namespace?**
   No, they do NOT need to be in the same namespace. In fact, they are intentionally placed in different namespaces:
   - ReleasePlan (RP) is in the TENANT namespace (your workspace)
   - ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is in the MANAGED namespace (controlled by platform engineers)

This separation ensures that:
- Developers can define release intentions
- Platform engineers control sensitive release credentials
- There's a clear security boundary between release planning and execution

The key is communication between the developer (creating RP) and the platform engineer (creating matching RPA) to ensure the resources align correctly.
