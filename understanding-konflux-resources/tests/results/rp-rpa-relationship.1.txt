I apologize for the inconvenience. Based on my existing knowledge about Konflux resources:

A ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references a ReleaseПлан (RP), but they do not necessarily need to be in the same namespace. The RPA typically points to a specific ReleaseПlan using a reference, which allows cross-namespace interactions.

Key points:
- The RPA uses a reference to link to the specific ReleaseПlan
- This reference can span different namespaces
- The relationship is typically defined through a spec field in the RPA that points to the RP's name and namespace

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend:
1. Checking the current Konflux documentation
2. Reviewing the specific Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for ReleaseПlan and ReleasePlanAdmission
3. Consulting with the Konflux development team or community for the most precise details about their current implementation

Would you like me to help you find more specific documentation about this relationship?
