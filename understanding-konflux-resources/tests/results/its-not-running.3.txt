I've prepared a comprehensive diagnostic framework for your Konflux ITS (Integrated Test Suite) issue. The investigation reveals several potential reasons why your tests might not be running after builds complete.

Could you please provide me with the following information:
1. The output of `kubectl get integrationtestscenario -n <your-namespace> -o yaml`
2. The output of `kubectl get application -n <your-namespace> -o yaml`
3. The output of `kubectl get component -n <your-namespace> -o yaml`
4. The recent PipelineRun logs
5. Integration service logs

These details will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS is not running. The most common issues are:
- Missing IntegrationTestScenario configuration
- Component not properly linked to the Application
- Snapshot creation failures
- Incorrect pipeline or resolver configurations

Would you mind sharing those details so I can provide a precise diagnosis?
