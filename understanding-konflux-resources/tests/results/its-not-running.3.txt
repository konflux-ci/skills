Let me help you diagnose this further. Could you provide me with:
1. The namespace you're using
2. The output of `kubectl get integrationtestscenarios -n <your-namespace>`
3. The output of `kubectl get snapshots -n <your-namespace>`
4. The details of your IntegrationTestScenario YAML

This will help me pinpoint exactly why your Integration Test Scenario is not running after builds complete. The most common issues are:
- Incorrect namespace placement
- Missing or incorrect Application reference
- Tekton pipeline not configured
- IntegrationTestScenario created after the build

Would you like to share those details so I can help you troubleshoot?
