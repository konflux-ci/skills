Based on the comprehensive troubleshooting guide, I have a few specific questions to help diagnose why your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is not running:

1. Can you confirm the namespace where your:
   - Application is created
   - Component is created
   - IntegrationTestScenario is created

2. Have you verified that a Snapshot was automatically created after your Component build completed?

3. Can you share the output of these kubectl commands in your tenant namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl get integrationtestscenarios
   kubectl get snapshots
   kubectl get components
   ```

The most common reasons an ITS doesn't run are:
- Incorrect namespace placement
- No Snapshot created
- ITS not referencing the correct Application
- Missing or misconfigured Tekton pipeline

Providing those details will help me pinpoint exactly why your IntegrationTestScenario is not triggering after builds.
