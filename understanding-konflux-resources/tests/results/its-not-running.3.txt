I apologize for the error. Based on my knowledge of Konflux, there are several key things to check when your IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) is not running:

1. **ReleasePlan Configuration**: 
   - Ensure you have a ReleasePlan (RP) that references your Component and Application
   - The ReleasePlan should specify which IntegrationTestScenarios should run

2. **Component Snapshot**:
   - Verify that a Component Snapshot is created after your build
   - The ITS needs a valid Snapshot to trigger tests

3. **ITS Specification**:
   - Check that your IntegrationTestScenario is correctly configured
   - Ensure it matches the Component and Application
   - Verify the test scenario's parameters are correct

4. **Namespace and Permissions**:
   - Confirm the ITS is in the correct namespace
   - Check that the service account has necessary permissions to run tests

Here are some specific things to verify:

```yaml
# Example ReleasePlan that might trigger your ITS
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlan
metadata:
  name: my-release-plan
spec:
  application: my-application
  test:
    scenarios:
      - my-integration-test-scenario
```

```yaml
# Example IntegrationTestScenario 
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: my-integration-test-scenario
spec:
  application: my-application
  resolverRef:
    # Specify test resolver (e.g., Tekton pipeline)
  components:
    - name: my-component
```

I recommend checking:
1. Are your Component and Application names exactly matching in the ITS and ReleasePlan?
2. Have you created a Snapshot after your build?
3. Do you have the correct permissions in your namespace?

Would you like me to help you debug by showing you how to check these configurations in your Konflux environment?
