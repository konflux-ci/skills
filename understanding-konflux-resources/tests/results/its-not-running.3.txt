I apologize for the tool errors. Based on my knowledge of Konflux resources, there are several key things to check when an Integration Test Scenario (ITS) is not running:

1. **Snapshot Creation**: Ensure that a Snapshot is created after your build. The IntegrationTestScenario typically requires a valid Snapshot to trigger.

2. **ITS Configuration**: 
   - Verify that your IntegrationTestScenario is correctly configured
   - Check that it's pointing to the correct Component and Application
   - Ensure the test scenario's spec matches your build and component details

3. **Namespace and Permissions**: 
   - Confirm the ITS is in the correct namespace
   - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to create and run test scenarios

4. **Build Status**: 
   - Make sure your Component build completed successfully
   - Check that the Snapshot was created from the successful build

To help diagnose the issue, I recommend checking the following:

1. Verify the Snapshot creation:
```bash
kubectl get snapshots -n <your-namespace>
```

2. Check the IntegrationTestScenario status:
```bash
kubectl describe integrationtestscenario <its-name> -n <your-namespace>
```

3. Look at the events or logs related to the ITS:
```bash
kubectl get events -n <your-namespace>
```

Could you provide more details about:
- The specific error or lack of action you're seeing
- The output of the commands above
- Your Component and Application configuration
- The IntegrationTestScenario manifest

This will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS is not running after builds complete.
