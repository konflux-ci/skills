Questions for you to help diagnose the issue:
1. Can you share the output of `oc get integrationtestscenarios`?
2. Do you have a ReleasePlan created for your Application?
3. Are there any Snapshots created after your builds?
4. What specific error (if any) are you seeing when the ITS fails to run?

These details will help me provide more targeted troubleshooting for your Konflux setup.
