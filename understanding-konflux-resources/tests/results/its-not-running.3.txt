I apologize for the tool errors. Based on my knowledge of Konflux, there are several common reasons why an IntegrationTestScenario might not run after builds complete:

1. **Release Plan Missing**: You mentioned having a Component and Application, but you might be missing a crucial Release Plan (RP) that triggers the IntegrationTestScenario.

2. **Snapshot Creation**: Ensure that a Snapshot is created after your build completes. The ITS typically requires a Snapshot to be present.

3. **Namespace and Access**: Verify that:
   - The ITS is in the same namespace as your Application
   - You have the correct permissions to create and run IntegrationTestScenarios
   - The ITS is properly configured to match your Component

4. **ITS Configuration**: Double-check your IntegrationTestScenario resource:
   - Correct Component reference
   - Proper test configuration
   - No syntax errors in the spec

To help diagnose this, I recommend checking a few things:

1. Confirm you have created a Release Plan that references your Application and Component
2. Verify the Snapshot was successfully created after your build
3. Check the ITS resource definition for any configuration issues

Could you share:
- The YAML for your IntegrationTestScenario
- The output of `kubectl get its -n <your-namespace>`
- The status of your recent build and Snapshot

This will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS is not running after builds complete.
