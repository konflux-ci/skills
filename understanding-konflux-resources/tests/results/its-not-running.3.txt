Can you provide more details about your setup? Specifically:
1. Did you manually create the IntegrationTestScenario resource?
2. What is the exact name of your Component and Application?
3. Can you share the YAML configuration for your IntegrationTestScenario, Component, and Application?

To help diagnose the issue, I'll need to know:
- Are you seeing any error messages in the Konflux UI or logs?
- Have you confirmed that builds are completing successfully?
- Are there any specific requirements for your integration tests?

A typical IntegrationTestScenario might look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1beta1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: my-test-scenario
spec:
  application: my-application
  component: my-component
  testTemplate:
    spec:
      container:
        image: your-test-image
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["your test command here"]
```

Providing these details will help me pinpoint exactly why your ITS is not running after builds complete.
