I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with invoking the skill. The error suggests that the skill could not be executed successfully. This could be due to several reasons:
1. The skill might not be properly configured
2. There might be a problem with the skill's implementation
3. The skill might require specific context or setup that is not currently available

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot this skill invocation or provide more information about what you were expecting to happen with the self-test-skill-invocation skill?
