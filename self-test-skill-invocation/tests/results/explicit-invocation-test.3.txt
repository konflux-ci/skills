I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with invoking the self-test-skill-invocation skill. The error suggests that the skill execution encountered a problem. This could be due to various reasons:

1. The skill might not be properly configured
2. There could be a permissions issue
3. The skill might be temporarily unavailable

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot this? Could you provide more context about how you intended to use this skill or what specific test you wanted to run?
