I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with invoking the self-test skill. This could be due to a few reasons:
1. The skill might not be properly configured
2. There could be a problem with the skill invocation framework
3. The skill might be unavailable or not correctly registered

To help diagnose this, could you provide more context about:
- How you expected the self-test skill to work
- Any specific instructions or documentation about the skill invocation framework
- Confirm if you've successfully used skill invocation before

If you'd like to troubleshoot, we could:
- Verify the skill's configuration
- Check the available skills list
- Ensure the skill invocation framework is set up correctly

Would you like to provide more details about the self-test skill or help me understand how to properly invoke it?
