I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with invoking the self-test skill. The error suggests that the skill could not be executed successfully. 

This could be due to a few reasons:
1. The skill might not be properly configured
2. There might be a temporary system issue
3. The skill might require additional setup

Would you like me to:
- Try invoking the skill again
- Provide more information about skill testing
- Check the available skills list

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed with testing the skill invocation framework.
