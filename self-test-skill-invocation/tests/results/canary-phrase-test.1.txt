I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with the skill invocation. The skill did not load successfully. This could be due to a few reasons:
1. The skill might not be currently available
2. There might be a configuration issue with the skill
3. The skill might require additional setup

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the skill invocation framework? I can:
- Verify the available skills
- Check if there are any specific requirements for skill invocation
- Investigate potential configuration issues

Please provide more context about what you're trying to achieve with the skill test, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
