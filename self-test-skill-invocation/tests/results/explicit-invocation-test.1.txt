I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with invoking the self-test-skill-invocation skill. The error suggests that the skill could not be executed successfully. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The skill might not be properly configured
2. There might be a problem with the skill's implementation
3. The skill might require additional setup or context

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot this? I can:
- Verify the available skills
- Check if there are any specific requirements for invoking this skill
- Provide more information about what might be causing the execution failure
