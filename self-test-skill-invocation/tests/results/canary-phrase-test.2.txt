I apologize, but it seems there might be an issue with invoking the skill. This could be due to a few reasons:
1. The skill might not be properly configured
2. There might be a problem with the skill invocation framework
3. The skill might not be currently available

Could you provide more context about how you'd like to proceed? Would you like me to:
- Double-check the available skills
- Verify the skill invocation process
- Investigate why the skill failed to load
