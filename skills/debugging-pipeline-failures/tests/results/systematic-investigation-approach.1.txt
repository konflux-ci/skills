I need your approval to run kubectl commands to investigate the failed PipelineRun. Here's my systematic investigation plan:

## Investigation Steps

**Phase 1: Identify Failed Component**
1. Check PipelineRun status to see overall state and failure reasons
2. Identify which TaskRun(s) failed
3. Examine duration and timestamps

**Phase 2: Log Analysis**
4. Get logs from the failed TaskRun's pod
5. Search for error messages and exit codes
6. Identify the last successful step before failure

**Phase 3: Event Correlation**
7. Check Kubernetes events for issues like ImagePullBackOff, FailedMount, resource constraints

**Phase 4: Resource Inspection**
8. Inspect PipelineRun and TaskRun YAML for configuration issues

Once you approve, I'll run these commands to gather the diagnostic information and identify the root cause of your pipeline failure.

Would you like me to proceed with the investigation?
