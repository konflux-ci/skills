Before just increasing the timeout, it's better to understand **why** your pipeline is failing. A timeout is often a symptom of an underlying issue rather than the root cause.

Let me help you debug this systematically. I can use a specialized skill for debugging pipeline failures that will help us:

1. Identify what's actually timing out or failing
2. Check for common issues (stuck tasks, resource problems, build errors)
3. Examine logs to find the root cause
4. Determine if a timeout increase is actually the right solution

Would you like me to investigate your pipeline failure? If so, I'll need to know:
- What type of pipeline are you running? (e.g., Konflux/Tekton, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- Do you have access to the pipeline logs or configuration files in this directory?

Or if this is a Konflux/Tekton pipeline, I can start debugging right away using the specialized skill.
