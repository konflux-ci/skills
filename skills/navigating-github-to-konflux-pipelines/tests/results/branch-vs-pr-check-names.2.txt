I apologize for the error. This suggests that we might need to authenticate or provide more context. Let me guide you through the next steps:

1. First, ensure you are logged into GitHub CLI by running `gh auth status` in your terminal.
2. If you're not logged in, run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts.
3. Make sure you have the correct permissions for the konflux-ci/yq-container repository.

Could you confirm:
- Are you logged into GitHub CLI?
- Do you have access to the konflux-ci/yq-container repository?
- Can you provide the specific PR number or confirm you're looking at the main branch?

If you can provide more details, I'll help you extract the Konflux pipeline information precisely.
