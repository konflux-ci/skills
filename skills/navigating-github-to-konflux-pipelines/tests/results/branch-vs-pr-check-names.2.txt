Great news! The checks on the main branch of konflux-ci/yq-container are actually passing. Let me break down the Konflux pipeline results:

1. Konflux On-Push Pipeline:
   - Name: `yq-on-push`
   - Status: ✅ Succeeded
   - PipelineRun: `yq-on-push-bfxjq`
   - Namespace: `rhtap-integration-tenant`
   - URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-on-push-bfxjq

2. Enterprise Contract Check:
   - Name: `yq-container-enterprise-contract`
   - Status: ✅ Succeeded
   - PipelineRun: `yq-container-enterprise-contract-7j4rr`
   - Namespace: `rhtap-integration-tenant`
   - URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-container-enterprise-contract-7j4rr

Note: The enterprise contract check shows 591 successes and 73 warnings, but the overall status is still successful.

There are no failing pipelines on the main branch. Is there a specific issue you're experiencing or would you like me to provide more details about these checks?
