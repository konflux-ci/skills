Let me help you extract the details from the Konflux URL you provided.

From the URL: `https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-on-pull-request-69sq8`

I'll parse out the key components:

1. Cluster: `konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com`
2. Namespace: `rhtap-integration-tenant`
3. PipelineRun Name: `yq-on-pull-request-69sq8`

You can use these details directly in kubectl commands. For example:

```bash
# To describe the PipelineRun
kubectl describe pipelinerun yq-on-pull-request-69sq8 -n rhtap-integration-tenant

# To get detailed information
kubectl get pipelinerun yq-on-pull-request-69sq8 -n rhtap-integration-tenant -o yaml
```

Would you like me to help you with any specific kubectl commands to investigate this PipelineRun?
