I'll analyze the check results for you:

1. The main branch has a failing Konflux pipeline check
2. The specific pipeline is "llm-compressor-on-push"
3. The pipeline run details are at: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-zfh65
4. The failure occurred in the "llm-compressor" task
5. The error is from a file at `/opt/app-root/src/pkg/reconciler/taskrun/taskrun.go` on line 470

For the PR checks, there's an interesting note: "To execute skipped test pipelines write comment `/ok-to-test`"

I recommend the following actions:
1. Review the PipelineRun details at the provided URL
2. If you want to trigger the checks, add a `/ok-to-test` comment to the PR
3. Check the logs for the failed "llm-compressor" task to understand the specific failure

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific error or take any further actions?
