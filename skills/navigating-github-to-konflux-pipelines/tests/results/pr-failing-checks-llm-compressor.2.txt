I apologize for the error. It seems I need your assistance to run the command. Could you help me by running the following commands locally and sharing the output:

1. `gh pr checks 15` (in the repository directory)
2. If that doesn't work, `gh pr view 15 --json statusCheckRollup`

In the meantime, I'll explain the next steps I'll take once I have the check information:
1. Filter for Konflux-related checks (containing "konflux" in the name)
2. Identify which specific Konflux check is failing
3. Extract the PipelineRun URL if possible

Could you provide the output of those commands or confirm the exact steps you'd like me to take to investigate the failing checks?
