I apologize for the confusion. Let me summarize what I've found:

The Konflux pipeline for PR #12 in ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo is failing. Specifically:
- Pipeline Name: llm-compressor-on-pull
- Status: Fail
- PipelineRun URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-pull-9z9gf

To investigate further, I recommend:
1. Check the PipelineRun URL to see detailed logs of the failing pipeline
2. Review the specific test or build step that caused the failure
3. Look at the error messages in the PipelineRun details

Would you like me to help you dig deeper into the specific failure reasons?
