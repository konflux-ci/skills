I apologize for the limitations. Since I cannot directly access the GitHub checks, I recommend the following steps:

1. Go to the pull request page on GitHub for konflux-ci/oras-container PR #249.
2. Look for the checks section, typically found near the bottom of the PR page.
3. Identify checks that are specifically related to Konflux. These typically:
   - Have names starting with "konflux-"
   - Are related to pipeline runs
   - May include terms like "build", "integration", or "test" in their names

Common Konflux checks to look for include:
- Konflux Build Pipeline
- Konflux Integration Tests
- Konflux Component Build
- Konflux Release Pipeline

If you can provide me with the specific names of the failing checks, I can help you interpret and investigate them further. The most important Konflux checks to focus on are usually:
- Build pipelines
- Integration test pipelines
- Component build checks

Would you like to share the exact names of the failing checks so I can provide more specific guidance?
