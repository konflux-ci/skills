I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify the situation:

The skill for navigating GitHub to Konflux pipelines seems to be temporarily unavailable or not properly configured. In this case, I recommend the following steps to investigate the failed 'functional-test' integration test:

1. Manually check the PR checks on GitHub:
   - Go to the Pull Request #249 in the konflux-ci/oras-container repository
   - Look for the 'functional-test' check in the Checks tab
   - Click on the details link to view the specific pipeline run

2. If you have access to the GitHub CLI, you can run:
   ```
   gh pr checks 249 --repo konflux-ci/oras-container
   ```

3. To get more detailed information about the PipelineRun:
   - Check the GitHub Actions or Konflux CI interface
   - Look for the specific PipelineRun URL in the failed check
   - If possible, use `kubectl` to describe the PipelineRun if you have cluster access

Would you like me to help you gather more specific information about the failed test? If you can provide any additional context or screenshots of the failed check, I can assist you in investigating the root cause.
