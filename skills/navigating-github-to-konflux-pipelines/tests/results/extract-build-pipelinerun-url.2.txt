I apologize for the persistent authentication issue. Since I cannot directly access the GitHub CLI in this environment, I recommend you retrieve the PipelineRun URL by:

1. Going to the Pull Request page on GitHub
2. Clicking on the "Checks" tab
3. Finding the 'yq-on-pull-request' check
4. Clicking on the check details, which should reveal the PipelineRun URL

The typical Konflux PipelineRun URL follows this format:
`https://{cluster}/ns/{namespace}/pipelinerun/{name}`

If you can provide me with the specific URL or the details from the check, I can help you parse out the cluster, namespace, and PipelineRun name for further debugging.

Would you like to share the details of the check or the PipelineRun URL you found?
