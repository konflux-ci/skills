I apologize for the persistent authentication issue. To proceed, I'll need you to confirm a few things:
1. Are you logged in to GitHub CLI (`gh`)?
2. Do you have access to the konflux-ci/oras-container repository?
3. Would you like to provide the PipelineRun URL directly if you have it?

The typical workflow to extract the PipelineRun details would involve:
1. Getting the commit SHA for the PR
2. Querying the check-runs for that commit
3. Filtering for the 'functional-test' check
4. Extracting the PipelineRun URL from the check output

Could you help me verify your GitHub CLI authentication or provide more context about accessing the PR checks?
