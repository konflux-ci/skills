Let me parse the PipelineRun URL details:

- **Cluster**: konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com
- **Namespace**: rhtap-integration-tenant
- **PipelineRun Name**: functional-test-78db6

To debug this further, you can use kubectl to inspect the PipelineRun in the specified cluster and namespace. The next step would be to use the debugging-pipeline-failures skill to get more details about why the functional test failed.

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific failure reasons for this PipelineRun?
