I see the PipelineRun URL directly in the check details. Let me extract it for you:

The PipelineRun URL is:
`https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-on-pull-request-69sq8`

Breaking down the URL:
- Cluster: konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com
- Namespace: rhtap-integration-tenant
- PipelineRun Name: yq-on-pull-request-69sq8

Note: The check actually shows as "pass", not "fail" as you mentioned. This could mean the check has been fixed since you last checked, or there might be a misunderstanding about the check status.

Would you like me to help you investigate further or provide more details about this PipelineRun?
