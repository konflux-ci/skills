I apologize for the error. It seems I need more information to proceed. Could you provide me with:
1. The full GitHub URL of the PR, or
2. Your GitHub personal access token (if you have one configured)
3. Confirm that you want me to investigate the failed 'yq-on-pull-request' check

The skill I loaded is designed to help extract PipelineRun information from GitHub checks, but I'll need your assistance to complete the investigation. Once you provide more details, I can help you find the specific PipelineRun URL for the failed check.
