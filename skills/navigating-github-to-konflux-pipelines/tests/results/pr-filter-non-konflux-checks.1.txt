I apologize for the restrictions. Since I cannot directly access the PR checks, I'll provide guidance on how to investigate Konflux checks:

1. Konflux checks typically have specific naming patterns related to Konflux pipelines, such as:
   - Integration tests
   - Build checks
   - Red Hat specific CI checks

To identify Konflux-specific checks, you should:
1. Open the PR on GitHub
2. Look for checks with names like:
   - `Konflux Integration Tests`
   - `Konflux Build Pipeline`
   - `Konflux CI` 
   - Checks in namespaces related to Red Hat or konflux-ci

Recommendations:
- Manually open the PR #249 in the konflux-ci/oras-container repository
- Look for checks that are marked as failed
- Focus on checks with names indicating Konflux-specific testing or build processes
- For detailed debugging, you'll want to click on the failed checks to see the specific error messages

If you'd like me to help you investigate further, could you provide:
1. The specific failed check names you see on the PR
2. Any error messages from those checks

I recommend using the skill to help parse the PipelineRun details once you have the specific check names.
