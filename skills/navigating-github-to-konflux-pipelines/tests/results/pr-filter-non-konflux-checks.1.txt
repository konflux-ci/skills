Here are the details of the two failing Konflux checks:

1. Enterprise Contract Check:
   - PipelineRun: oras-container-enterprise-contract-9lkhf
   - Status: FAILURE
   - Details: 327 successes, 30 warnings, 6 failures
   - Logs: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/oras-container-enterprise-contract-9lkhf/logs/verify

2. Functional Test:
   - PipelineRun: functional-test-78db6
   - Status: FAILURE
   - Logs: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/functional-test-78db6/logs/functional

I recommend investigating these two PipelineRuns to understand why the checks are failing. The Enterprise Contract check seems to have some specific failures (6 out of 357 checks), while the Functional Test has a general failure.

Would you like me to help you dig deeper into the reasons for these check failures?
