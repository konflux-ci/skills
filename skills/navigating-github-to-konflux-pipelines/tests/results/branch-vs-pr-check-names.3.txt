Good news! It appears that the builds are actually successful. There are two Konflux pipelines:

1. **yq-container-enterprise-contract / yq**:
   - Status: Completed
   - Conclusion: Success
   - PipelineRun: [yq-container-enterprise-contract-7j4rr](https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-container-enterprise-contract-7j4rr)
   - Note: Has 73 warnings, but overall passed

2. **yq-on-push**:
   - Status: Completed
   - Conclusion: Success
   - PipelineRun: [yq-on-push-bfxjq](https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-on-push-bfxjq)
   - All tasks succeeded

Despite your mention of a failing build, both Konflux pipelines for the main branch show as successful. The second pipeline (yq-on-push) includes multiple checks like security scans, build processes, and other validations, all of which passed.

Would you like me to investigate further? Some potential next steps:
1. Check if you're seeing a specific error not reflected in these pipeline runs
2. Verify the exact commit SHA you're concerned about
3. Look into the warnings in the enterprise-contract pipeline
