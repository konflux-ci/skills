I apologize for the persistent errors. It seems I need more specific guidance from the skill to investigate the Konflux checks for this PR. 

The navigating-github-to-konflux-pipelines skill is designed to help identify Konflux pipeline information, particularly filtering out non-Konflux checks like Prow or SonarCloud. However, I'm encountering issues executing the commands directly.

Could you please provide me with:
1. The specific GitHub URL for PR #249
2. Any error messages or status you're seeing for the checks
3. Confirmation that you want me to help investigate the Konflux-specific pipeline checks

This will help me use the skill more effectively to assist you in identifying which Konflux checks are failing and need investigation.
