Based on the investigation, there are two Konflux checks that failed for PR #249:

1. **Red Hat Konflux / functional-test / oras-container**
   - PipelineRun URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/functional-test-78db6
   - Status: Failed
   - Details: The functional test task failed without specific error details

2. **Red Hat Konflux / oras-container-enterprise-contract / oras-container**
   - PipelineRun URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/oras-container-enterprise-contract-9lkhf
   - Status: Failed
   - Details: The verify task failed with:
     - 327 successes
     - 30 warnings
     - 6 failures

In contrast, the build check **Red Hat Konflux / oras-container-on-pull-request** passed successfully.

To investigate further, you would need to:
1. Check the detailed logs for the functional test PipelineRun
2. Investigate the 6 failures in the enterprise contract verification
3. Review the warnings and specific failure details in the PipelineRun URLs provided

Would you like me to help you dig deeper into these specific failures?
