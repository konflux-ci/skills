I apologize for the confusion. Let me summarize what I've found:

1. The Konflux pipeline `llm-compressor-on-pull` is failing for PR #12
2. The PipelineRun URL is: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-pull-9z9gf

To help you debug, I recommend:
1. Visit the PipelineRun URL to see detailed failure logs
2. Check the specific stage or task that caused the pipeline to fail
3. Review the error messages in the pipeline details

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific failure reason by guiding you through the PipelineRun details?
