I apologize for the persistent authentication issue. This typically happens when the GitHub CLI is not logged in or the repository access is restricted. 

Could you please:
1. Confirm that you're logged into GitHub CLI by running `gh auth status` in your terminal
2. Verify that you have access to the `ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo` repository
3. If possible, provide the specific failing check details or a screenshot of the failed checks

In the meantime, I'll guide you through the troubleshooting process:
- Check the GitHub PR page to see which specific checks are failing
- Look for any checks with names containing "konflux" or related to builds/tests
- Note the specific check name and its conclusion (failed/error)

If you can provide more details about the failing checks, I can help you extract the PipelineRun URL and debug the specific issue.
