It appears that there are no checks currently reported for this PR. This could be due to several reasons:
1. The checks haven't been triggered yet
2. The branch might be in a state where checks are not running
3. There might be an issue with the CI configuration

The PR description suggests this is a Renovate bot update for a Konflux-related task, specifically updating a task reference from `bb2f8f1` to `3dc39ea`.

I recommend the following steps:
1. If you want to trigger the checks, you can try commenting `/ok-to-test` on the PR as suggested in the PR description
2. Verify that the CI/CD pipeline is configured correctly for this repository
3. Check if there are any pending actions required to start the checks

Would you like me to help you investigate further or take any specific actions to trigger the checks?
