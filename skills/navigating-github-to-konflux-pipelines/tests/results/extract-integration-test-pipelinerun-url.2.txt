I apologize for the error. It seems I need to explicitly authenticate or get more context. Let me guide you through the next steps:

1. Ensure you're logged into GitHub CLI by running `gh auth login` in your terminal before our session.
2. Verify the repository name and PR number are correct.

Since I cannot directly run the command, I'll explain how to extract the PipelineRun details:

1. First, get the commit SHA for the PR:
```bash
gh pr view 249 --repo konflux-ci/oras-container --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid
```

2. Then, query the check runs for the specific commit and filter for the functional test:
```bash
gh api repos/konflux-ci/oras-container/commits/<SHA>/check-runs \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.name | contains("functional-test")) | {name: .name, status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion, output: .output.text}'
```

3. Extract the PipelineRun URL from the output text, typically using:
```bash
gh api repos/konflux-ci/oras-container/commits/<SHA>/check-runs \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.name | contains("functional-test")) | .output.text' \
  | grep -o 'https://[^"]*konflux[^"]*pipelinerun/[^"]*' | head -1
```

The extracted URL will follow the format:
`https://{cluster}/ns/{namespace}/pipelinerun/{name}`

You'll want to:
- Replace `<SHA>` with the actual commit SHA
- Use the full command in your terminal with `gh` CLI
- Ensure you're authenticated with GitHub

Would you like to proceed by running these commands in your terminal? If you provide the exact commit SHA or run the authentication steps, I can help you parse the PipelineRun details.
