To debug this further, you'll want to use the kubectl command to describe the PipelineRun in the rhtap-integration-tenant namespace. The full command would be:

```bash
kubectl describe pipelinerun functional-test-78db6 -n rhtap-integration-tenant
```

This will give you detailed information about why the functional test failed, including any error messages, task statuses, and potential reasons for the failure.

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific failure details of this PipelineRun?
