I apologize for the persistent error. This might indicate that additional authentication or configuration is needed. Let me provide you with the steps you can take:

1. Ensure you are logged in to GitHub CLI:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```

2. Verify you have the correct repository context:
   ```
   gh repo view konflux-ci/yq-container
   ```

3. If the above commands work, you can then run:
   ```
   gh api repos/konflux-ci/yq-container/commits/main/check-runs
   ```

These steps will help you retrieve the check runs for the main branch of the yq-container repository. The key information we're looking for are:
- Konflux-related checks
- Their conclusion (success/failure)
- The details URL for the failing checks

Would you like to help me troubleshoot the GitHub CLI access, or do you have additional context about the failing build that could help us investigate?
