From the output, I can see multiple Konflux pipeline runs for different branches and PRs. However, the most recent pipeline runs (as of 2025-11-13) appear to be successful. 

Let me help you find the specific Konflux pipeline details:

1. Most recent successful pipelines:
   - PipelineRun URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-on-pull-request-m2f99
   - Branch: konflux/mintmaker/main/lock-file-maintenance
   - Conclusion: SUCCESS
   - Time: 2025-11-13T02:15:32Z

2. Enterprise Contract Pipeline:
   - Check Run URL: https://red.ht/trusted
   - Conclusion: SUCCESS
   - Time: 2025-11-13T02:15:52Z

It seems that the build is NOT failing on the main branch, contrary to your initial statement. All recent pipeline runs appear to be successful. 

Would you like me to help you investigate further? Could you provide more specific details about the failure you're experiencing?
