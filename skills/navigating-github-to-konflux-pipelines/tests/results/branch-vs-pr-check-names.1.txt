Good news! The build on the main branch of konflux-ci/yq-container is actually successful. Let me break down the Konflux pipeline checks:

1. "yq-on-push" PipelineRun (Build Check):
   - Status: ✅ Succeeded
   - PipelineRun URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-on-push-bfxjq
   - Namespace: rhtap-integration-tenant
   - Commit SHA: b588d63b2ca3279ba54bd30d5a35fbf882ce3130

2. "yq-container-enterprise-contract" (Integration Test):
   - Status: ✅ Succeeded
   - PipelineRun URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rhtap-integration-tenant/pipelinerun/yq-container-enterprise-contract-7j4rr
   - Note: This check shows 591 successes and 73 warnings, but is still marked as passed

Both Konflux checks on the main branch have passed successfully. There are no failing pipelines to investigate at this time. Would you like me to provide more details about the pipeline runs or explain anything specific about the checks?
