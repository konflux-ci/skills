Good news! The build on the main branch is actually passing. There are two Konflux checks:

1. "Red Hat Konflux / yq-container-enterprise-contract / yq":
   - Conclusion: Success
   - PipelineRun: yq-container-enterprise-contract-7j4rr

2. "Red Hat Konflux / yq-on-push":
   - Conclusion: Success
   - PipelineRun: yq-on-push-bfxjq

Both checks have completed successfully. The builds, image scans, and enterprise contract checks all passed. There are some warnings in the enterprise contract check (73 warnings), but these did not cause the check to fail.

If you're experiencing any specific issues or want to understand the details of these checks, I can help you dive deeper into the PipelineRun logs or investigate the warnings. Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the check results?
