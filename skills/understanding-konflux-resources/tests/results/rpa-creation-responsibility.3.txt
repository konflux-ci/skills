To directly answer your question: No, you do not create the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA). 

As explained in the skill document, the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is:
- Created by the Platform Engineer
- Goes in the managed namespace (NOT your tenant namespace)
- Defines the release pipeline and contains credentials

You (as a developer/application owner) are responsible for creating:
- The ReleasePlan (RP) in your tenant namespace
- The Application
- The Components
- The IntegrationTestScenarios (if needed)

The Platform Engineer will create the corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) in the managed namespace to complete the release setup. This separation ensures that sensitive release credentials are kept in a controlled, restricted namespace while allowing you to define your release plans.

Would you like me to elaborate on the specific roles and how ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission work together?
