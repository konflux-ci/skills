Based on the skill documentation, I can provide a detailed answer about how the ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) references the ReleasePlan (RP):

The ReleasePlan (RP) and ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) are designed to work across different namespaces:
- ReleasePlan (RP) is created in the tenant namespace by the application owner
- ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) is created in the managed namespace by the Platform Engineer

Key points about their relationship:
1. The RPA references the RP across namespace boundaries
2. They do NOT need to be in the same namespace
3. The RPA is manually created by the Platform Engineer to link the release plan with the necessary credentials and release pipeline configuration

Specifically:
- The RP is created in the tenant namespace and points to the Application
- The RPA in the managed namespace contains production credentials and references the original ReleasePlan
- This separation allows:
  - Developers to define release plans in their own namespace
  - Platform teams to manage release credentials securely in a separate namespace

Example workflow:
1. Developer creates a ReleasePlan in tenant namespace
2. Platform Engineer creates a corresponding ReleasePlanAdmission in managed namespace
3. The RPA links to the RP using a cross-namespace reference
4. When a release is triggered, the system uses both resources to execute the release

The key takeaway is that RPAs are NOT automatically created, and they intentionally exist in a different namespace from the ReleasePlan to maintain proper separation of concerns and security.
