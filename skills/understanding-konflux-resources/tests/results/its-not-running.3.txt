Based on the Konflux resources skill details, I can help diagnose why your Integration Test Scenario (ITS) is not running after builds complete. Let me ask a few clarifying questions and provide some potential solutions:

1. Have you created an IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) resource in your tenant namespace? 
   - The ITS must exist BEFORE builds complete
   - It should reference the Application that contains your Components

2. Confirm the following checklist:
   - ✅ Application resource created
   - ✅ Component(s) created with correct git repository configuration
   - ❓ IntegrationTestScenario created
   - ❓ Tekton pipeline referenced by ITS exists

Common reasons why ITS might not run:
- ITS is not created
- ITS is in the wrong namespace (must be in tenant namespace)
- Tekton pipeline referenced by ITS is missing
- Snapshot not created (this is auto-created, so unlikely the issue)

Could you share:
1. The name of your Application
2. The names of your Components
3. The YAML for your IntegrationTestScenario (or confirm if you've created one)
4. The namespace you're working in

This will help me precisely diagnose why your Integration Test Scenario is not running after builds complete.
