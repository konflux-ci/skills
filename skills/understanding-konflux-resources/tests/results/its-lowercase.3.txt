Based on the Konflux resources skill, here are some key things to check:

1. IntegrationTestScenarios (ITS) should be in the tenant namespace.
2. They are triggered automatically after a Snapshot is created.
3. Common reasons for ITS not triggering include:
   - No ITS resource created
   - ITS not referencing the correct Application
   - Builds not completing successfully
   - Snapshot not being created

Could you provide more details about:
- Your ITS configuration (if you have one)
- The Component and Application resources
- The results of your recent builds

This will help me diagnose why the Integration Test Scenario isn't triggering after builds.
