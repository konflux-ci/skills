I apologize for the inconvenience. Based on the provenance information, I can confirm:

- The image was built from the commit 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd
- The source repository is https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
- The build was part of a Konflux pipeline run

If you're experiencing issues with the build, I recommend:
1. Check the build logs at the Konflux pipeline URL
2. Review the specific commit in the GitHub repository
3. Verify if there are any recent changes that might have introduced problems

Would you like me to help you dig deeper into why the build isn't working as expected? If you can provide more details about the specific issues you're experiencing, I can help you investigate further.
