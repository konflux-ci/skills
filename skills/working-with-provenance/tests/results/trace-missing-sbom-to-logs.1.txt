Let me summarize the findings:

1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5
2. Source Repository: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
3. Commit SHA: 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL should help you investigate why the SBOM might be missing. You can open this URL in a web browser to view the detailed pipeline run logs and check if there were any issues during the SBOM generation step.

I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL to inspect the pipeline run
2. Look for any error messages related to SBOM generation
3. Check if the SBOM task was skipped or failed

Would you like me to help you dig deeper into the specific reason for the missing SBOM?
