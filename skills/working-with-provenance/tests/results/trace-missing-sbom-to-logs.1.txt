Let me summarize the findings for you:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Source Repository: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo

The build log URL should provide more details about why the SBOM might be missing. You can open this URL in a web browser to investigate the specific build details and any potential issues with SBOM generation.

Would you like me to help you investigate further why the SBOM might be missing from this build?
