Here's what I found:
1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5
2. Git Repository: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
3. Commit SHA: 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL should help you investigate why the SBOM is missing. I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL in a web browser
2. Look for any SBOM generation steps or errors
3. Check if there are any pipeline configuration issues preventing SBOM generation

Would you like me to help you further investigate the SBOM generation process or explain what might have caused its absence?
