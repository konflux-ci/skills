I apologize for the error. Since I cannot directly fetch the commit details, I suggest you:
1. Visit https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd
2. Review the changes made in this specific commit
3. Check if those changes might be related to the issue you're experiencing with the build

Is there anything specific about the build's behavior that isn't working as expected? I can help you investigate further if you provide more context about the problems you're seeing.
