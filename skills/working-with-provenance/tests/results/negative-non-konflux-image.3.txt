I apologize for the error. Let me rephrase my recommendation:

To find the source code for the nginx:latest Docker Hub image:
1. Visit https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx
2. Look for the Dockerfile in this repository
3. You can explore different branches for various nginx versions
4. The official Docker Hub page (https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) also links to this source repository

If you want the exact Dockerfile used to build the latest image, I recommend:
- Checking the official GitHub repository
- Using `docker pull nginx:latest` locally
- Running `docker history nginx:latest` to see layer information
- Consulting the Docker Hub documentation for the most current source details

Would you like me to help you explore the nginx Docker image source in more detail?
