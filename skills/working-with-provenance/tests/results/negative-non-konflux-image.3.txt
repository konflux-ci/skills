I'll provide the information based on my existing knowledge:

The official nginx Docker image source code can be found in two main repositories:

1. Docker Official Image Repository:
   - GitHub: https://github.com/docker-library/nginx
   - This repository contains the official Dockerfiles and build scripts for the nginx Docker image

2. Nginx Source Code Repository:
   - GitHub: https://github.com/nginx/nginx
   - This is the main source code repository for the nginx web server itself

To see the Dockerfile and build context for the latest nginx image, I recommend:
1. Visit https://github.com/docker-library/nginx
2. Look for the Dockerfile corresponding to the latest version
3. Check the different variants (alpine, debian-based, etc.)

If you want to explore the exact source used for a specific version:
1. Go to Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)
2. Check the tags and their corresponding Dockerfile links
3. Navigate to the specific Dockerfile in the docker-library/nginx GitHub repository

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about the nginx:latest image source?
