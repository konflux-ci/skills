I'll provide the information based on my existing knowledge:

For the official nginx Docker image, you can find the source code in multiple locations:

1. Official GitHub Repository:
   - https://github.com/nginx/nginx - The core nginx source code
   - https://github.com/docker-library/nginx - Official Docker image source code

2. Docker Hub Repository:
   - https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx - Official nginx Docker image page

The Dockerfile and build scripts for the official nginx Docker image are typically maintained in the docker-library/nginx GitHub repository. This repository contains:
- Dockerfile templates
- Version-specific build scripts
- Configuration management for different nginx versions

To view the exact source used for a specific tag:
1. Go to https://github.com/docker-library/nginx
2. Check the appropriate version branch or tag
3. Look for the Dockerfile and associated build scripts

For the absolute latest source of the nginx code itself, visit the main nginx GitHub repository at https://github.com/nginx/nginx.

Would you like me to help you explore the source code further or explain how to download and inspect it?
