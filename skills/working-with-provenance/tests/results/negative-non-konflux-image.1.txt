I apologize for the error. Let me provide you with the standard ways to find the source code for the nginx Docker image:

1. Official GitHub Repository:
   - The official nginx source code is maintained on GitHub at: https://github.com/nginx/nginx
   - For the Docker image specifically, check: https://github.com/nginx/docker-nginx

2. Docker Hub Source:
   - Visit the official nginx Docker Hub page: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
   - The "Source" link on this page will direct you to the GitHub repositories

3. Dockerfile Investigation:
   - You can pull the image and inspect its Dockerfile:
     ```bash
     docker pull nginx:latest
     docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh nginx:latest
     cat /Dockerfile  # Inside the container
     ```

4. Official Nginx Website:
   - The primary source code repository is at: https://hg.nginx.org/nginx/

For the most up-to-date and official source code, I recommend checking the GitHub repositories mentioned above. The nginx:latest tag typically points to the mainline version of nginx, which is actively maintained.

Would you like me to help you explore the source code further or explain how to investigate the image's details?
