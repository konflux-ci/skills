I apologize for the error. Let me provide you with the information based on my existing knowledge:

The official nginx Docker image source code can be found in several locations:

1. Official Docker Hub Repository:
   - Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
   - Official Image Repository: https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx

2. Nginx Source Code:
   - Main Nginx Repository: https://github.com/nginx/nginx

To get the specific source for the `nginx:latest` image, you can:
1. Visit the Docker Hub page
2. Check the GitHub repositories mentioned above
3. Look at the Dockerfile in the docker-nginx repository to understand how the image is built

The build process typically involves:
- Pulling the official Nginx source code
- Compiling it with specific configurations
- Creating a minimal image that runs the compiled Nginx binary

If you want to inspect the exact source used for a specific version:
1. Check the tags on the Docker Hub page
2. Look for the corresponding commit in the docker-nginx GitHub repository

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about the nginx:latest image source?
