Here's what I found:

1. **Build Log URL**:

3. **Commit SHA**:

The build log URL will provide the full details of the pipeline run and any errors encountered during the build. You can open this URL in a web browser to view the complete logs and understand why the build failed.

Would you like me to help you interpret the specific errors from the build log?
