I've found the following information for you:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Commit Link: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL will provide the full details of the pipeline run and any errors encountered during the build. I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL in a web browser to see the detailed pipeline logs
2. Check the commit link to understand the specific code changes that might have triggered the build failure

Would you like me to help you further investigate the specific errors in the build?
