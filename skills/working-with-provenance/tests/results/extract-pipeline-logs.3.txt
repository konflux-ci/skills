I've found the build log URL for your Konflux image. Here are the details:

1. **Build Log URL**: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. **Source Repository**: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo

3. **Commit SHA**: 
   7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

You can open the build log URL in your browser to view the full pipeline logs and investigate the specific errors you encountered. The log should provide detailed information about the build process and any failures.

Would you like me to help you interpret the logs or provide more context about the build?
