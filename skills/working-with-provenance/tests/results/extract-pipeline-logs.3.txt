Here's a summary of the build information:

1. **Build Log URL**: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. **Git Repository**: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo

3. **Commit SHA**: 
   7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

To investigate the failed build, I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL in your browser
2. Look for specific error messages in the pipeline run logs
3. Check the commit in the GitHub repository to see if there are any obvious issues with the code

Is there anything specific about the build failure you'd like me to help you investigate further?
