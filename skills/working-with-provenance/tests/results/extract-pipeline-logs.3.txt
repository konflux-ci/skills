I've found the details for the failed Konflux build:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Source Commit: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

You can click on the build log URL to view the full pipeline logs and investigate the specific errors that caused the build to fail. The source commit link will show you the exact code changes that triggered this build.

Is there anything specific about the build failure you'd like me to help you with?
