Here's what I found:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Source Commit: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

You can open the build log URL in your web browser to see the full pipeline logs and investigate the errors you encountered. The log URL points directly to the Konflux UI where you can view the detailed pipeline run information.

Is there anything specific about the errors you'd like me to help you investigate further? Would you like me to help you analyze the build log or provide more context about the build?
