I found the following information for you:

1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5
2. Source Commit: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL should help you investigate why the SBOM is missing. You can open this link in a browser to view the full pipeline run details. The log might reveal why the SBOM generation task failed or was not included in the build.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to help you with regarding this missing SBOM? Would you like me to help you analyze the build logs or investigate the cause of the missing SBOM?
