I've found the following information for you:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Source Repository: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo

3. Commit SHA: 
   7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL should help you investigate why the SBOM might be missing. I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL in a browser
2. Look for any SBOM-related tasks or errors
3. Check if the SBOM generation step was skipped or failed

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific reason for the missing SBOM?
