I've found the following information for you:

1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5
2. Source Repository: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
3. Commit SHA: 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL should provide more details about why the SBOM might be missing. You can open this URL in a web browser to investigate the specific build details and see if there were any issues with SBOM generation during the build process.

Would you like me to help you investigate further why the SBOM might be missing from this build?
