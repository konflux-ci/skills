Here's a summary of the findings for the Konflux build:

1. **Build Log URL**:

The build log URL should help you investigate why the SBOM might be missing. You can open this URL in a web browser to view the full pipeline run details and logs. The logs will likely provide insight into whether there was an issue with SBOM generation during the build process.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to help you find in these build logs or any further investigation you'd like me to conduct?
