I apologize for the error. The environment doesn't allow direct Docker operations. 

Key Takeaways:
- For nginx:latest source code, refer to:
  1. https://github.com/nginx/nginx (main nginx source)
  2. https://github.com/docker-library/nginx (Docker's official image build files)

These repositories will give you:
- Complete source code for Nginx
- Dockerfiles used to build the official images
- Build scripts and configuration details

Would you like me to elaborate on how to explore these repositories or explain more about the nginx image sources?
