I apologize for the error. Let me explain the sources for nginx:latest based on my knowledge:

The official source code for the nginx Docker Hub image can be found in two primary locations:

1. Official Docker Hub Repository:
   - Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
   - Official Docker Image Repository: https://github.com/docker-library/nginx

2. Nginx Source Code Repository:
   - Official Nginx Source: https://github.com/nginx/nginx

To explore the Docker image's source:
1. Visit the Docker Library Nginx repository on GitHub
2. Check the Dockerfiles in that repository to see how the official image is built
3. The Dockerfiles will reference the specific Nginx version and build process

For the most up-to-date source:
```bash
# Clone the Docker Library Nginx repository
git clone https://github.com/docker-library/nginx.git

# Clone the Nginx source repository
git clone https://github.com/nginx/nginx.git
```

Key things to look for:
- Dockerfile in the docker-library/nginx repo
- Build scripts
- Version-specific configurations

Would you like me to help you clone or explore these repositories further?
