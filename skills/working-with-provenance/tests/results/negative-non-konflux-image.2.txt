I'll try again with a direct search:

The official nginx source code is maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/nginx/nginx

To get the exact source for the latest version:

1. Go to https://github.com/nginx/nginx
2. Check the tags or releases to find the version corresponding to the latest Docker Hub image
3. You can clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nginx/nginx.git
```

A few additional points about nginx:latest:
- The Docker Hub image is maintained by the Docker Nginx team
- The source is open-source and available on GitHub
- The Dockerfile for the official image is typically maintained in a separate repository: https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx

If you want to investigate the specific Dockerfile used to build the nginx:latest image, I recommend:
1. Checking the Docker Hub page for nginx
2. Looking at the official nginx Docker image repository on GitHub

Would you like me to help you find more specific details about the nginx:latest source code or Dockerfile?
