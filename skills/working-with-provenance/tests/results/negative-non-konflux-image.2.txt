To find the source code for the `nginx:latest` Docker Hub image, you have two main options:

1. **Official Docker Image Source Repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx
   - This repository contains the Dockerfiles and build configurations used to create the official nginx images.

2. **NGINX Open Source Project:**
   - Visit: https://nginx.org/
   - This is the source of the actual nginx web server software.

Key things to note:
- The Docker Hub image is built using the Dockerfiles in the `docker-nginx` repository
- The actual nginx source code comes from the nginx.org project
- You can find different variants (Alpine, Debian) in the Docker repository
- The repository includes build scripts, configurations, and documentation

Would you like me to help you explore the source code repository further or explain anything specific about the nginx Docker image?
