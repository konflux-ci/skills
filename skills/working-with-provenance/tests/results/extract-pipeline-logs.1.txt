I've retrieved two key pieces of information for you:

1. Pipeline Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Source Commit URL:
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The pipeline log URL will show you the full details of the failed build. You can open this URL in a web browser to see the complete logs and understand why the build failed. 

The commit URL allows you to see the exact code changes that triggered this build, which might provide additional context about potential build issues.

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific errors in the build log?
