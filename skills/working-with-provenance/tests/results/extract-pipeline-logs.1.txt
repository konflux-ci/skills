Great! I've found the following information for you:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Source Repository: 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo

The build log URL will show you the full pipeline logs, including any errors that caused the build to fail. You can open this URL in a web browser to see the detailed logs and understand what went wrong during the Konflux build.

Would you like me to help you investigate the specific errors in the build log?
