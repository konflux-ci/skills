Great! I've found the full pipeline logs for your Konflux build:

1. Build Log URL: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Commit Link (for additional context): 
   https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo/commit/7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

You can click on the build log URL to view the detailed pipeline run logs and investigate the specific errors you encountered. The commit link allows you to see the exact code changes that were part of this build.

Is there anything specific about the build errors you'd like me to help you investigate further?
