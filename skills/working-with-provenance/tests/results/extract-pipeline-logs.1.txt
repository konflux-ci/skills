Great! I've found the details for your Konflux build. Here's a summary:

1. **Build Log URL**: 
   https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. **Repository**:

3. **Commit SHA**: 
   7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

I recommend opening the build log URL in your browser to investigate the specific errors you encountered. The log should provide detailed information about what went wrong during the build process. 

Would you like me to help you understand the specific errors from the build log?
