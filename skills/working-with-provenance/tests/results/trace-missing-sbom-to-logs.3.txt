Here's what I found:

1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5
2. Source Repository: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
3. Commit SHA: 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd (from the image tag)

The missing SBOM could be due to several reasons:
- SBOM generation might have failed in the build pipeline
- SBOM might not be configured for this particular build
- Potential issue with the SBOM generation task

I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL to investigate why the SBOM was not generated
2. Check the repository's build configuration (e.g., .tekton/ directory) to verify SBOM generation settings

Would you like me to help you dig deeper into why the SBOM is missing?
