Here's what I found about the build:

1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5
2. Repository: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
3. Commit SHA: 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd

The build log URL should help you investigate why the SBOM might be missing. You can open this URL in a web browser to view the detailed pipeline run logs and understand what might have happened during the build process.

Would you like me to help you investigate further why the SBOM might be missing from this build?
