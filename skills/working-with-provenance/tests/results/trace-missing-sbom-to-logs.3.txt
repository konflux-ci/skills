Based on the investigation, here's what I found:

1. Build Log URL: https://konflux-ui.apps.kflux-prd-rh03.nnv1.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/konflux-ai-sig-tenant/pipelinerun/llm-compressor-on-push-lvnc5

2. Repository Details:
   - Repository: https://github.com/ralphbean/llm-compressor-hermetic-demo
   - Commit SHA: 7f9a553dd100ba700fc8f9da942f8dfcecf6a1bd
   - Commit Message: "Document llm-compressor-remote-oci-ta task in README"
   - Branch: main
   - Sender: ralphbean

The build log URL should provide more details about why the SBOM might be missing. Unfortunately, I can't directly access the logs from this interface, but you can open the URL to investigate further.

Some potential reasons for a missing SBOM could include:
1. SBOM generation task failure
2. Configuration issues in the build pipeline
3. Intentional omission of SBOM generation
4. Temporary build system glitch

I recommend:
1. Open the build log URL to check for any specific errors
2. Verify the build pipeline configuration
3. Check if SBOM generation is explicitly configured in the repository's CI/CD setup

Would you like me to help you investigate further or explain any of these details in more depth?
