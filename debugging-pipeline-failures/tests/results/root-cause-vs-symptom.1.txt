I see that I need your approval to run kubectl commands. To help you debug your pipeline failure properly, I need some information:

**Can you provide:**
1. **PipelineRun name** - What's the name of the failing pipeline?
2. **Namespace** - Which namespace is it in?
3. **What error message** do you see (if any)?
4. **How long does it run** before failing/timing out?

Or if you prefer, you can run this command yourself and share the output:
```bash
kubectl get pipelinerun -n <your-namespace>
```

**Important:** Simply increasing the timeout is usually **not** the right solution because:

- **If it's timing out** → Something might be hanging or stuck (network issue, process deadlock)
- **If it's failing before timeout** → Timeout isn't the problem at all
- **If builds are genuinely slow** → You might need caching or optimization, not just more time

Once you share the pipeline details, I can help you:
1. Check the actual logs to see what's failing
2. Identify if it's a timeout, resource issue, image pull problem, or build failure
3. Recommend the proper fix (which might not be timeout-related at all)

What information can you share about the failing pipeline?
