Before just increasing the timeout, let's investigate **why** your pipeline is failing. Timeouts are often a symptom of an underlying issue, not the root cause itself.

Simply increasing the timeout might mask problems like:
- **Hung processes** or deadlocks that will never complete
- **Resource starvation** (CPU, memory, network)
- **Inefficient operations** that could be optimized
- **Infrastructure issues** like slow I/O or network problems
- **Misconfigurations** in the pipeline setup

I can help you debug this. I have access to a specialized skill for debugging Konflux/Tekton pipeline failures. To investigate, I'll need to know:

1. **What type of pipeline is this?** (Konflux/Tekton, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
2. **Where is it timing out?** (Specific stage/task/step)
3. **Can you share:**
   - The pipeline configuration file
   - Recent failure logs
   - Or point me to the pipeline definition in your repo

If this is a Konflux/Tekton pipeline, I can invoke the debugging skill to systematically analyze the failure. Otherwise, I can still help investigate once I see the pipeline setup and logs.

What information can you provide about the failing pipeline?
