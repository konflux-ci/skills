Based on the skill prompt, here's a systematic approach to debug your stuck PipelineRun:

## Immediate Checks for Stuck PipelineRun

Since your PipelineRun has been in "Running" state for over an hour, here's what to check:

### 1. Check TaskRun Status
```bash
kubectl get taskruns -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun=<pr-name> -n <namespace>
```
This shows which TaskRuns are running, pending, or completed. Look for:
- **Pending** TaskRuns → Resource constraint issues
- **Running** TaskRuns → Identify which step is hanging

### 2. Identify the Stuck Pod
```bash
kubectl get pods -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun=<pr-name> -n <namespace>
```
Note any pods that are in "Running" state for a long time.

### 3. Check Pod Logs
```bash
# Get logs from the stuck pod
kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers=true -n <namespace>

# Or check specific step if you know which one
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c step-<step-name> -n <namespace>
```
Look for:
- Last line of output (is it making progress?)
- Network operations that may be hanging
- Download/install steps that are stuck

### 4. Check Events
```bash
kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -20
```
Look for:
- `FailedScheduling` → No resources available
- `FailedMount` → Volume/PVC issues
- Image pull problems

### 5. Check Resource Constraints
```bash
# Check if resources are available
kubectl describe namespace <namespace> | grep -A5 "Resource Quotas"

# Check node resources
kubectl top pods -n <namespace>
```

## Common Causes for Stuck Pipelines

1. **Slow network operations** - Downloads timing out or very slow
2. **Pending resource allocation** - Waiting for CPU/memory quota
3. **Hanging build process** - Process waiting for input or deadlocked
4. **PVC mount issues** - Workspace not mounting properly
5. **Timeout set too high** - Process failing silently but timeout not reached

## Quick Action

If you provide your PipelineRun name and namespace, I can help you run these diagnostic commands to identify the exact issue.
