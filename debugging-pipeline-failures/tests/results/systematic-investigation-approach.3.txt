I need your approval to run kubectl commands to investigate the failed PipelineRun. These commands will:

1. **Get the PipelineRun status** - to see the overall state and failure information
2. **Describe the PipelineRun** - to get detailed information about conditions, failed tasks, and timestamps

Once approved, I'll follow this systematic investigation process:

1. ✓ Check PipelineRun status and identify which components failed
2. Identify the specific TaskRun(s) that failed
3. Get logs from the failed TaskRun pods to find error messages
4. Check Kubernetes events for additional context (image pull issues, resource constraints, etc.)
5. Correlate all findings to identify the root cause and recommend fixes

Should I proceed with running these kubectl commands to investigate your failed PipelineRun?
