Before increasing the timeout, let's first investigate **why** your pipeline is failing. Timeouts are often a symptom, not the root cause. Simply increasing the timeout might mask underlying issues like:

- **Actual errors** in tasks that aren't obvious
- **Stuck processes** waiting for resources
- **Performance problems** that should be optimized
- **Infrastructure issues** like image pulls, networking, or resource constraints

I can help you debug this systematically. I have a specialized skill for debugging pipeline failures that can help identify the real issue.

**What I need to know:**
1. What type of pipeline is this? (Konflux/Tekton, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
2. What error messages or symptoms are you seeing?
3. Where are the pipeline logs/details located?

If this is a **Konflux/Tekton pipeline**, I can use the debugging skill to:
- Check PipelineRun and TaskRun statuses
- Analyze logs for actual failures
- Identify stuck tasks (Pending, ImagePullBackOff, etc.)
- Find resource or configuration issues

Would you like me to help debug the pipeline failure, or do you have more details you can share about what's happening?
