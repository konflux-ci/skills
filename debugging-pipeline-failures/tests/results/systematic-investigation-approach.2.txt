Based on the debugging pipeline failures guide, here's how to systematically investigate your failed PipelineRun 'component-build-xyz':

## Step-by-Step Investigation

**1. Check PipelineRun Status**
```bash
kubectl get pipelinerun component-build-xyz -n user-tenant
kubectl describe pipelinerun component-build-xyz -n user-tenant
```
This will show you the overall status, conditions, and which TaskRun(s) failed.

**2. Identify Failed TaskRuns**
```bash
kubectl get taskruns -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun=component-build-xyz -n user-tenant
```
Look for TaskRuns with `Failed` status to pinpoint which step failed.

**3. Examine Logs from Failed TaskRun**
```bash
# First, find the pod for the failed TaskRun
kubectl get pods -l tekton.dev/taskRun=<failed-tr-name> -n user-tenant

# Then get logs from all containers
kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers=true -n user-tenant

# Or get logs from a specific step if you know which one failed
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c step-<step-name> -n user-tenant
```

**4. Check Kubernetes Events**
```bash
kubectl get events -n user-tenant --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```
Look for critical events like:
- `FailedScheduling` → Resource constraints
- `ImagePullBackOff` → Registry/image problems
- `FailedMount` → Volume/PVC issues

**5. Get Detailed Resource Information**
```bash
kubectl get pipelinerun component-build-xyz -n user-tenant -o yaml
```

## Quick Diagnosis

The **most common failure patterns** are:

| If you see... | Root cause likely is... |
|---------------|------------------------|
| `ImagePullBackOff` in events | Wrong image name, missing registry credentials, or image doesn't exist |
| `OOMKilled` in pod status | Memory limit too low for the build process |
| Exit code 127 in logs | Command not found - wrong container image used |
| TaskRun stuck in `Pending` | Resource quota exceeded or insufficient cluster resources |
| Volume mount errors | PVC not bound or workspace misconfiguration |

Run the commands above and share what you find - the error messages from the logs and events will help identify the specific root cause!
