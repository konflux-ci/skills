I need your approval to run kubectl commands to investigate the pipeline failure. Here's my systematic debugging approach:

## Investigation Plan

**Phase 1: Identify Failed Component**
1. Check PipelineRun status and overall failure details
2. Identify which TaskRun(s) failed

**Phase 2: Log Analysis**  
3. Get logs from failed TaskRun pods to see specific error messages

**Phase 3: Event Correlation**
4. Check Kubernetes events for timing-related issues (ImagePullBackOff, resource constraints, etc.)

**Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis**
5. Correlate all findings to identify the root cause

## Commands I'll Run

1. `kubectl get pipelinerun component-build-xyz -n user-tenant` - Check overall status
2. `kubectl describe pipelinerun component-build-xyz -n user-tenant` - Get failure details
3. `kubectl get taskruns -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun=component-build-xyz -n user-tenant` - Find failed TaskRuns
4. `kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers -n user-tenant` - Get logs from failed pods
5. `kubectl get events -n user-tenant --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'` - Check recent events

Would you like me to proceed with these commands to investigate the failure?
