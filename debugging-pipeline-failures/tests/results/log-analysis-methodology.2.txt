Based on the debugging guide, here's how to find the error in your failed build TaskRun:

## Quick Steps to Find Your Error

**1. Get the logs from your failed TaskRun:**

```bash
# First, find the pod associated with your TaskRun
kubectl get pods -l tekton.dev/taskRun=<your-taskrun-name> -n <namespace>

# Then get the logs (replace with your pod name)
kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers=true -n <namespace>
```

**2. If you know which step failed, get logs from that specific step:**

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c step-<step-name> -n <namespace>
```

**3. Check the TaskRun status for clues:**

```bash
kubectl describe taskrun <your-taskrun-name> -n <namespace>
```

Look for the `Status` section which shows:
- Which step failed
- Exit code details
- Failure reasons

**4. Check Kubernetes events for additional context:**

```bash
kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -20
```

## Common Exit Code 1 Causes

Since you got exit code 1, it typically means:
- **Build script error** - compilation failed, tests failed, linting error
- **Command failed** - a command in your build script returned an error
- **Missing dependency** - required tool or package not found

The logs from step 1 will show the actual error message before the exit.

**Can you provide:**
1. Your TaskRun name and namespace?
2. Or paste the output from `kubectl describe taskrun <name>`?

This will help me pinpoint the exact error for you.
