I'd advise against simply increasing the timeout without understanding **why** the pipeline is failing. Timeouts are usually symptoms of underlying issues, not the root cause.

Let me help you debug this properly. I have access to a specialized skill for debugging Konflux/Tekton pipeline failures that can help us investigate:

- **PipelineRun failures** - overall pipeline issues
- **TaskRun problems** - individual tasks stuck, pending, or failing
- **Build errors** - compilation, image pull issues (ImagePullBackOff, etc.)
- **Timeout root causes** - why tasks are hanging

Before we just increase the timeout, let's figure out what's actually going wrong. This could be:
- Resource constraints (CPU/memory limits too low)
- Network issues (image pulls, external dependencies)
- Infinite loops or hung processes
- Misconfigured tasks or missing dependencies
- Actual legitimate slowness that needs optimization

Would you like me to help investigate the pipeline failure? If so, I can use the debugging skill to systematically check:
1. Recent PipelineRun status and logs
2. Which specific TaskRuns are failing/stuck
3. Resource usage and constraints
4. Error messages and events

Just let me know, or if you can share any error messages or the pipeline name, I can start investigating right away.
