I can help you debug your failed TaskRun. To find the error in a Kubernetes/Tekton TaskRun that failed with exit code 1, you'll need to examine the logs and status of the TaskRun.

Here are the steps to diagnose the issue:

1. **Get the TaskRun status and recent events:**
```bash
kubectl describe taskrun <taskrun-name>
```
This will show you the status, conditions, and recent events that might indicate what went wrong.

2. **Check the logs of the failed step:**
```bash
kubectl logs <taskrun-pod-name>
```
Or if you know the specific step that failed:
```bash
kubectl logs <taskrun-pod-name> -c step-<step-name>
```

3. **List all containers in the TaskRun pod to identify which step failed:**
```bash
kubectl get pods <taskrun-pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'
```

4. **Get logs from all steps:**
```bash
tkn taskrun logs <taskrun-name>
```
(if you have the `tkn` CLI installed)

**Could you provide:**
- The name of your failed TaskRun (or paste the output of `kubectl get taskruns`)
- Or the specific error message you're seeing

I can then help you run the appropriate commands to pinpoint the exact error. If this is a Konflux/Tekton pipeline issue and you'd like systematic debugging assistance, I can also invoke the debugging-pipeline-failures skill which has specialized tools for this scenario.
