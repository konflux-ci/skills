Based on the debugging guide, here's how to find the error in your failed build TaskRun:

## Quick Steps to Find the Error

1. **Get the logs from the failed step:**
```bash
# First, find the pod associated with your TaskRun
kubectl get pods -l tekton.dev/taskRun=<your-taskrun-name> -n <namespace>

# Then get logs from the build step (or whichever step failed)
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c step-build -n <namespace>

# If you don't know which step failed, get all logs:
kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers=true -n <namespace>
```

2. **Check TaskRun details to see which step failed:**
```bash
kubectl describe taskrun <your-taskrun-name> -n <namespace>
```

Look for the "Status" section which shows which step failed and the exit code.

3. **Review Kubernetes events for additional context:**
```bash
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<pod-name> -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

## What to Look For in the Logs

- **Error messages**: Search for keywords like "error", "failed", "fatal"
- **The last successful operation** before the failure
- **Exit code explanation**: 
  - Exit code 1 = General failure (check the error message in logs)
  - Exit code 127 = Command not found
  - Exit code 137 = OOMKilled (out of memory)

## Common Exit Code 1 Causes

- Build script errors (compilation failures, test failures)
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration errors
- Network issues during dependency downloads

**Do you have the TaskRun name and namespace handy?** I can help you run these commands to find the specific error.
