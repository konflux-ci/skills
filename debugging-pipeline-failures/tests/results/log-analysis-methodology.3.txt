Based on the debugging guide, here's how to find the error in your failed build TaskRun:

## Quick Steps to Find Your Error

**1. Get the TaskRun logs** (most likely to show the error):
```bash
# Find the pod associated with your TaskRun
kubectl get pods -l tekton.dev/taskRun=<your-taskrun-name> -n <namespace>

# Get logs from all containers to see the error
kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers=true -n <namespace>
```

**2. Check the TaskRun details** to see which step failed:
```bash
kubectl describe taskrun <your-taskrun-name> -n <namespace>
```

Look for the "Status" section which will show:
- Which step failed
- The exit code (you mentioned exit code 1)
- Failure reason/message

**3. Get logs from the specific failed step** (once you identify it):
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c step-<step-name> -n <namespace>
```

**4. Check events** for additional context:
```bash
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<pod-name> -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

## What to Look For in Logs

Exit code 1 typically means a general script/command failure. Search the logs for:
- Error messages (grep for "error", "failed", "fatal")
- The last command that executed before failure
- Build tool specific errors (npm, maven, gradle, etc.)
- Test failures
- Missing files or dependencies

**Need help running these commands?** If you provide me with:
- Your TaskRun name
- Your namespace
- Access to run kubectl commands in your environment

I can help you execute these commands and analyze the output to pinpoint the exact error.
